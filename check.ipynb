       "'The Generative AI (GenAI) landscape is rapidly evolving, making it hard to definitively say what\\'s \"trending\" at any given moment.  However, several key trends are clearly emerging:\\n\\n**1. Multimodal Models:**  The biggest trend is the move beyond text-only generation.  Models are increasingly capable of handling multiple modalities simultaneously, such as text, images, audio, and video. This leads to more creative and complex applications, like generating videos from text prompts, creating realistic images from audio descriptions, or translating languages across different media types.\\n\\n**2. Agent-Based AI:**  We\\'re seeing a rise in AI agents that can autonomously perform tasks and interact with their environment. These agents can plan, reason, and learn, going beyond simple prompt-response interactions.  Think of AI that can browse the web, gather information, and synthesize it into a report, or an AI that manages your calendar and proactively solves scheduling conflicts.\\n\\n**3. Personalized and Customized Experiences:**  GenAI is increasingly being used to create highly personalized experiences. This includes customized learning materials, tailored marketing campaigns, and even personalized creative content like music or art.  The focus is on adapting to individual user preferences and needs.\\n\\n**4. Enhanced Explainability and Controllability:**  There\\'s growing demand for more transparent and controllable GenAI models.  Users want to understand how the AI arrived at its output and have more influence over the creative process.  This involves developing techniques for explaining model decisions and providing better tools for guiding the generation process.\\n\\n**5. Integration into Existing Workflows:**  GenAI is no longer a standalone technology; it\\'s being integrated into existing software and applications across various industries.  We see this in tools for code generation, marketing automation, customer service chatbots, and design software.  The focus is on seamless integration and enhancing existing workflows.\\n\\n**6. Focus on Ethical Considerations:**  As GenAI becomes more powerful, concerns about bias, misinformation, and misuse are increasingly prominent.  There\\'s a growing emphasis on developing ethical guidelines, responsible AI practices, and techniques to mitigate potential harms.\\n\\n**7. Democratization of Access:**  While powerful models still require significant computational resources, there\\'s a push to make GenAI more accessible to a wider range of users and developers. This includes developing more efficient models, providing user-friendly interfaces, and offering cloud-based services.\\n\\n**8.  Increased focus on efficiency and cost reduction:**  The computational cost of training and running large GenAI models is substantial.  Research is focused on making these models more efficient, reducing their memory footprint, and lowering the energy consumption involved in their operation.\\n\\n\\nThese trends are interconnected and constantly evolving.  The future of GenAI will likely be shaped by the interplay of these advancements, leading to even more powerful and transformative applications.'"

      "The K-Means clustering algorithm is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique used to partition data points into distinct groups (clusters) based on their similarity.  The goal is to find groups where data points within the same cluster are as similar as possible, while data points in different clusters are as dissimilar as possible.  Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Core Idea:**\n",
      "\n",
      "K-Means aims to find *k* cluster centers (centroids) that best represent the data. Each data point is then assigned to the cluster whose centroid is closest to it.  The algorithm iteratively refines the positions of the centroids to minimize the overall distance between data points and their assigned centroids.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Algorithm Steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initialization:**\n",
      "   - Choose the number of clusters, *k*. This is often a hyperparameter that needs to be determined beforehand (e.g., through experimentation or domain knowledge).\n",
      "   - Randomly initialize *k* centroids.  These can be randomly selected data points or randomly generated points within the data's range.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Assignment:**\n",
      "   - Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on a distance metric (typically Euclidean distance).  This creates *k* clusters.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Update:**\n",
      "   - Recalculate the centroids for each cluster by computing the mean (average) of all data points assigned to that cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Iteration:**\n",
      "   - Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.  Convergence is typically achieved when the centroids no longer move significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Distance Metrics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The choice of distance metric influences the shape and characteristics of the clusters.  Common metrics include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Euclidean distance:** The straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.  This is the most common choice.\n",
      "* **Manhattan distance:** The sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates.  This is less sensitive to outliers than Euclidean distance.\n",
      "* **Cosine similarity:** Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors.  Often used for text data or other high-dimensional data where magnitude is less important than direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strengths:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Relatively simple and easy to understand.**\n",
      "* **Computationally efficient,** especially for large datasets (compared to some other clustering algorithms).\n",
      "* **Scalable** to large datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Weaknesses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Requires specifying *k* beforehand.**  Determining the optimal number of clusters can be challenging and often requires experimentation (e.g., using the elbow method or silhouette analysis).\n",
      "* **Sensitive to initial centroid placement.**  Different initializations can lead to different final clusterings.  Running the algorithm multiple times with different random initializations and selecting the best result (e.g., based on inertia) can mitigate this.\n",
      "* **Assumes spherical clusters.**  It struggles with clusters of non-spherical shapes or clusters with varying densities.\n",
      "* **Sensitive to outliers.** Outliers can significantly influence the position of centroids.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Applications:**\n",
      "\n",
      "K-Means is widely used in various fields, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Customer segmentation:** Grouping customers based on their purchasing behavior or demographics.\n",
      "* **Image compression:** Representing images with fewer colors by clustering similar pixels.\n",
      "* **Document clustering:** Grouping documents based on their content.\n",
      "* **Anomaly detection:** Identifying data points that are significantly different from the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, K-Means is a powerful and versatile clustering algorithm, but its limitations should be considered when choosing it for a particular task.  Understanding its strengths and weaknesses is crucial for effective application.\n"

Although his ideas were powerful, their delivery was\\nunfailingly gentle.\\nReaders of this magazine need no elaboration of his achievements as\\nmeasured by the standard of creativity. It is rare that the founder of a disci-\\npline does not find his work eclipsed in rather short order by successors.\\nBut over forty years after publication of the book that brought structure\\nand logic to a disorderly and confused activity, it is difficult to think of pos-\\nsible candidates for even the runner-up position in the field of security\\nanalysis. In an area where much looks foolish within weeks or months\\nafter publication, Ben’s principles have remained sound—their value often\\nenhanced and better understood in the wake of financial storms that\\ndemolished flimsier intellectual structures. His counsel of soundness\\nbrought unfailing rewards to his followers—even to those with natural\\nabilities inferior to more gifted practitioners who stumbled while follow-\\ning counsels of brilliance or fashion.\\nA remarkable aspect of Ben’s dominance of his professional field was\\nthat he achieved it without that narrowness of mental activity that concen-\\ntrates all effort on a single end. It was, rather, the incidental by-product of\\nan intellect whose breadth almost exceeded definition. Certainly I have\\nnever met anyone with a mind of similar scope. Virtually total recall,\\nunending fascination with new knowledge, and an ability to recast it in a\\nform applicable to seemingly unrelated problems made exposure to his\\nthinking in any field a delight.\\nBut his third imperative—generosity—was where he succeeded beyond\\nall others. I knew Ben as my teacher, my employer, and my friend. In each\\nrelationship—just as with all his students, employees, and friends—there\\nwas an absolutely open-ended, no-scores-kept generosity of ideas, time,\\nand spirit. If clarity of thinking was required, there was no better place to\\ngo. And if encouragement or counsel was needed, Ben was there.\\nWalter Lippmann spoke of men who plant trees that other men will sit\\nunder. Ben Graham was such a man.\\nReprinted from the Financial Analysts Journal, November/December 1976.'),\n",

Before Graham,\\nmoney managers behaved much like a medieval guild, guided largely by\\nsuperstition, guesswork, and arcane rituals. Graham’s Security Analysis\\nwas the textbook that transformed this musty circle into a modern pro-\\nfession.1\\nAnd The Intelligent Investor is the first book ever to describe, for\\nindividual investors, the emotional framework and analytical tools that\\nare essential to financial success. It remains the single best book on\\ninvesting ever written for the general public. The Intelligent Investor\\nwas the first book I read when I joined Forbes Magazine as a cub\\nreporter in 1987 , and I was struck by Graham’s certainty that, sooner\\nor later, all bull markets must end badly. That October, U.S. stocks suf-\\nfered their worst one-day crash in history, and I was hooked. (Today,\\nafter the wild bull market of the late 1990s and the brutal bear market\\nthat began in early 2000, The Intelligent Investor reads more prophet-\\nically than ever.)\\nGraham came by his insights the hard way: by feeling firsthand the\\nanguish of financial loss and by studying for decades the history and\\npsychology of the markets. He was born Benjamin Grossbaum on\\nMay 9, 1894, in London; his father was a dealer in china dishes and\\nfigurines.2 The family moved to New York when Ben was a year old. At\\nfirst they lived the good life—with a maid, a cook, and a French gov-\\n1 Coauthored with David Dodd and first published in 1934.\\n2 The Grossbaums changed their name to Graham during World War I,\\nwhen German-sounding names were regarded with suspicion.'),\n",

But Ben’s father died in 1903, the\\nporcelain business faltered, and the family slid haltingly into poverty.\\nBen’s mother turned their home into a boardinghouse; then, borrow-\\ning money to trade stocks “on margin, ” she was wiped out in the crash\\nof 1907 . For the rest of his life, Ben would recall the humiliation of\\ncashing a check for his mother and hearing the bank teller ask, “Is\\nDorothy Grossbaum good for five dollars?”\\nFortunately, Graham won a scholarship at Columbia, where his \\nbrilliance burst into full flower. He graduated in 1914, second in his\\nclass. Before the end of Graham’s final semester, three departments—\\nEnglish, philosophy, and mathematics—asked him to join the faculty.\\nHe was all of 20 years old.\\nInstead of academia, Graham decided to give Wall Street a shot.\\nHe started as a clerk at a bond-trading firm, soon became an analyst,\\nthen a partner, and before long was running his own investment part-\\nnership.\\nThe Internet boom and bust would not have surprised Graham. In\\nApril 1919, he earned a 250% return on the first day of trading for\\nSavold Tire, a new offering in the booming automotive business; by\\nOctober, the company had been exposed as a fraud and the stock\\nwas worthless.\\nGraham became a master at researching stocks in microscopic,\\nalmost molecular, detail. In 1925, plowing through the obscure\\nreports filed by oil pipelines with the U.S. Interstate Commerce Com-\\nmission, he learned that Northern Pipe Line Co.—then trading at $65\\nper share—held at least $80 per share in high-quality bonds. (He\\nbought the stock, pestered its managers into raising the dividend, and\\ncame away with $110 per share three years later.)\\nDespite a harrowing loss of nearly 70% during the Great Crash of\\n1929–1932, Graham survived and thrived in its aftermath, harvesting\\nbargains from the wreckage of the bull market. There is no exact\\nrecord of Graham’s earliest returns, but from 1936 until he retired in\\n1956, his Graham-Newman Corp. gained at least 14.7% annually,\\nversus 12.2% for the stock market as a whole—one of the best long-\\nterm track records on Wall Street history.3\\n3 Graham-Newman Corp. was an open-end mutual fund (see Chapter 9)\\nthat Graham ran in partnership with Jerome Newman, a skilled investor in his\\nown right. For much of its history, the fund was closed to new investors. I am'),\n",

Combining his extraordinary intellectual\\npowers with profound common sense and vast experience, Graham\\ndeveloped his core principles, which are at least as valid today as they\\nwere during his lifetime:\\n• A stock is not just a ticker symbol or an electronic blip; it is an\\nownership interest in an actual business, with an underlying value\\nthat does not depend on its share price.\\n• The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustain-\\nable optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified\\npessimism (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor\\nis a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.\\n• The future value of every investment is a function of its present\\nprice. The higher the price you pay, the lower your return will be.\\n• No matter how careful you are, the one risk no investor can ever\\neliminate is the risk of being wrong. Only by insisting on what\\nGraham called the “margin of safety”—never overpaying, no mat-\\nter how exciting an investment seems to be—can you minimize\\nyour odds of error.\\n• The secret to your financial success is inside yourself.

Comparatively little will be said here about the technique of\\nanalyzing securities; attention will be paid chiefly to investment\\nprinciples and investors’ attitudes. We shall, however, provide a\\nnumber of condensed comparisons of specific securities—chiefly in\\npairs appearing side by side in the New York Stock Exchange list—\\nin order to bring home in concrete fashion the important elements\\ninvolved in specific choices of common stocks.\\nBut much of our space will be devoted to the historical patterns\\nof financial markets, in some cases running back over many\\ndecades. To invest intelligently in securities one should be fore-\\narmed with an adequate knowledge of how the various types of\\nbonds and stocks have actually behaved under varying condi-\\ntions—some of which, at least, one is likely to meet again in one’s\\nown experience. No statement is more true and better applicable to\\nWall Street than the famous warning of Santayana: “Those who do\\nnot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”\\nOur text is directed to investors as distinguished from specula-\\ntors, and our first task will be to clarify and emphasize this now all\\nbut forgotten distinction. We may say at the outset that this is not a\\n“how to make a million” book. There are no sure and easy paths to\\nriches on Wall Street or anywhere else. It may be well to point up\\nwhat we have just said by a bit of financial history—especially\\nsince there is more than one moral to be drawn from it. In the cli-\\nmactic year 1929 John J. Raskob, a most important figure nationally\\nas well as on Wall Street, extolled the blessings of capitalism in an\\narticle in the Ladies’ Home Journal, entitled “Everybody Ought to Be\\n1'),\n",

If the General Motors tycoon was right, this was\\nindeed a simple road to riches. How nearly right was he? Our\\nrough calculation—based on assumed investment in the 30 stocks\\nmaking up the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)—indicates\\nthat if Raskob’s prescription had been followed during 1929–1948,\\nthe investor’s holdings at the beginning of 1949 would have been\\nworth about $8,500. This is a far cry from the great man’s promise\\nof $80,000, and it shows how little reliance can be placed on such\\noptimistic forecasts and assurances. But, as an aside, we should\\nremark that the return actually realized by the 20-year operation\\nwould have been better than 8% compounded annually—and this\\ndespite the fact that the investor would have begun his purchases\\nwith the DJIA at 300 and ended with a valuation based on the 1948\\nclosing level of 177. This record may be regarded as a persuasive\\nargument for the principle of regular monthly purchases of strong\\ncommon stocks through thick and thin—a program known as \\n“dollar-cost averaging.”\\nSince our book is not addressed to speculators, it is not meant\\nfor those who trade in the market. Most of these people are guided\\nby charts or other largely mechanical means of determining the\\nright moments to buy and sell. The one principle that applies to\\nnearly all these so-called “technical approaches” is that one should\\nbuybecause a stock or the market has gone up and one should sell\\nbecause it has declined.

An unprecedented advance in the interest rate on high-grade\\nbonds.\\n2. A fall of about 35% in the price level of leading common\\nstocks, ending in May 1970.

A persistent inflation of wholesale and consumer’s prices,\\nwhich gained momentum even in the face of a decline of gen-\\neral business in 1970.\\n4. The rapid development of “conglomerate” companies, fran-\\nchise operations, and other relative novelties in business and\\nfinance.

That was too good to be true. At long last the stock market has\\n“returned to normal,” in the sense that both speculators and stock\\ninvestors must again be prepared to experience significant and per-\\nhaps protracted falls as well as rises in the value of their holdings.\\nIn the area of many secondary and third-line common stocks,\\nespecially recently floated enterprises, the havoc wrought by the\\nlast market break was catastrophic. This was nothing new in\\nitself—it had happened to a similar degree in 1961–62—but there\\nwas now a novel element in the fact that some of the investment\\nfunds had large commitments in highly speculative and obviously\\novervalued issues of this type. Evidently it is not only the tyro who\\nneeds to be warned that while enthusiasm may be necessary for\\ngreat accomplishments elsewhere, on Wall Street it almost invari-\\nably leads to disaster.\\nThe major question we shall have to deal with grows out of the\\nhuge rise in the rate of interest on first-quality bonds. Since late 1967\\nthe investor has been able to obtain more than twice as much\\nincome from such bonds as he could from dividends on representa-\\ntive common stocks. At the beginning of 1972 the return was 7.19%\\non highest-grade bonds versus only 2.76% on industrial stocks.\\n(This compares with 4.40% and 2.92% respectively at the end of\\n1964.) It is hard to realize that when we first wrote this book in 1949\\nthe figures were almost the exact opposite: the bonds returned only\\n2.66% and the stocks yielded 6.82%. 2 In previous editions we have\\nconsistently urged that at least 25% of the conservative investor’s\\nportfolio be held in common stocks, and we have favored in general\\na 50–50 division between the two media. We must now consider\\nwhether the current great advantage of bond yields over stock\\nyields would justify an all-bond policy until a more sensible rela-\\ntionship returns, as we expect it will. Naturally the question of con-\\ntinued inflation will be of great importance in reaching our decision\\nhere. A chapter will be devoted to this discussion.*\\nWhat This Book Expects to Accomplish 5\\n* See Chapter 2. As of the beginning of 2003, U.S. Treasury bonds matur-\\ning in 10 years yielded 3.8%, while stocks (as measured by the Dow Jones\\nIndustrial Average) yielded 1.9%.

And\\nsimilarly for a number of other growth industries and growth com-\\npanies. But this is not as easy as it always looks in retrospect. To\\nbring this point home at the outset let us add here a paragraph that\\nwe included first in the 1949 edition of this book.\\nSuch an investor may for example be a buyer of air-transport\\nstocks because he believes their future is even more brilliant than\\nthe trend the market already reflects.

(“The fault, dear investor, is\\nnot in our stars—and not in our stocks—but in ourselves. . . .”) This\\nhas proved the more true over recent decades as it has become\\nmore necessary for conservative investors to acquire common\\nstocks and thus to expose themselves, willy-nilly, to the excitement\\nand the temptations of the stock market.

The habit of relat-\\ning what is paid to what is being offered is an invaluable trait in\\ninvestment. In an article in a women’s magazine many years ago\\nwe advised the readers to buy their stocks as they bought their gro-\\nceries, not as they bought their perfume.

What exactly does Gra-\\nham mean by an “intelligent” investor? Back in the first edition of this\\nbook, Graham defines the term—and he makes it clear that this kind of\\nintelligence has nothing to do with IQ or SAT scores. \\nIt simply means\\nbeing patient, disciplined, and eager to learn; you must also be able to\\nharness your emotions and think for yourself. This kind of intelligence,\\nexplains Graham, “is a trait more of the character than of the brain. ”2\\nThere’s proof that high IQ and higher education are not enough to\\nmake an investor intelligent. In 1998, Long-Term Capital Management\\nL.P., a hedge fund run by a battalion of mathematicians, computer \\nscientists, and two Nobel Prize–winning economists, lost more than \\n$2 billion in a matter of weeks on a huge bet that the bond market\\nwould return to “normal. ” But the bond market kept right on becoming\\nmore and more abnormal—and LTCM had borrowed so much money\\nthat its collapse nearly capsized the global financial system.3\\nAnd back in the spring of 1720, Sir Isaac Newton owned shares in\\nthe South Sea Company, the hottest stock in England. Sensing that\\nthe market was getting out of hand, the great physicist muttered that\\nhe “could calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the\\nmadness of the people. ” Newton dumped his South Sea shares, pock-\\neting a 100% profit totaling £7 ,000. But just months later, swept up in\\nthe wild enthusiasm of the market, Newton jumped back in at a much\\nhigher price—and lost £20,000 (or more than $3 million in today’s\\nmoney). For the rest of his life, he forbade anyone to speak the words\\n“South Sea” in his presence.4\\n2 Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor (Harper & Row, 1949), p. 4.\\n3 A “hedge fund” is a pool of money, largely unregulated by the government,\\ninvested aggressively for wealthy clients.

Operations not\\nmeeting these requirements are speculative.”\\nWhile we have clung tenaciously to this definition over the\\nensuing 38 years, it is worthwhile noting the radical changes that\\nhave occurred in the use of the term “investor” during this period.\\nAfter the great market decline of 1929–1932 all common stocks\\nwere widely regarded as speculative by nature. (A leading author-\\nity stated flatly that only bonds could be bought for investment. 2)\\nThus we had then to defend our definition against the charge that\\nit gave too wide scope to the concept of investment.\\nNow our concern is of the opposite sort. We must prevent our\\nreaders from accepting the common jargon which applies the term\\n“investor” to anybody and everybody in the stock market.

Think of our suggested definition of investment given\\nabove, and compare it with the sale of a few shares of stock by an\\ninexperienced member of the public, who does not even own what\\nhe is selling, and has some largely emotional conviction that he\\nwill be able to buy them back at a much lower price.

In general what\\ncourse should he follow and what return can he expect under\\n“average normal conditions”—if such conditions really exist? To\\nanswer these questions we shall consider first what we wrote on\\nthe subject seven years ago, next what significant changes have\\noccurred since then in the underlying factors governing the\\ninvestor’s expectable return, and finally what he should do and\\nwhat he should expect under present-day (early 1972) conditions.\\n1. What We Said Six Years Ago\\nWe recommended that the investor divide his holdings between\\nhigh-grade bonds and leading common stocks; that the proportion\\nheld in bonds be never less than 25% or more than 75%, with the\\nconverse being necessarily true for the common-stock component;\\nthat his simplest choice would be to maintain a 50–50 proportion\\nbetween the two, with adjustments to restore the equality when\\nmarket developments had disturbed it by as much as, say, 5%. As\\nan alternative policy he might choose to reduce his common-stock\\ncomponent to 25% “if he felt the market was dangerously high,”\\nand conversely to advance it toward the maximum of 75% “if he\\nfelt that a decline in stock prices was making them increasingly\\nattractive.”\\nIn 1965 the investor could obtain about 4 1⁄2% on high-grade tax-\\nable bonds and 3 1⁄4% on good tax-free bonds. The dividend return\\non leading common stocks (with the DJIA at 892) was only about\\n3.2%. This fact, and others, suggested caution. We implied that “at\\nnormal levels of the market” the investor should be able to obtain\\nan initial dividend return of between 31⁄2% and 4 1⁄2% on his stock\\npurchases, to which should be added a steady increase in underly-\\ning value (and in the “normal market price”) of a representative\\n22 The Intelligent Investor'),\n",

That rate had aver-\\naged a good deal better than 10% for listed stocks as a whole, and it\\nwas quite generally regarded as a sort of guarantee that similarly\\nsatisfactory results could be counted on in the future. Few people\\nwere willing to consider seriously the possibility that the high rate\\nof advance in the past means that stock prices are “now too high,”\\nand hence that “the wonderful results since 1949 would imply not\\nvery good but bad results for the future.”4\\n2. What Has Happened Since 1964\\nThe major change since 1964 has been the rise in interest rates on\\nfirst-grade bonds to record high levels, although there has since\\nbeen a considerable recovery from the lowest prices of 1970. The\\nobtainable return on good corporate issues is now about 71⁄2% and\\neven more against 4 1⁄2% in 1964. In the meantime the dividend\\nreturn on DJIA-type stocks had a fair advance also during the mar-\\nket decline of 1969–70, but as we write (with “the Dow” at 900) it is\\nless than 3.5% against 3.2% at the end of 1964. The change in going\\ninterest rates produced a maximum decline of about 38% in the\\nmarket price of medium-term (say 20-year) bonds during this\\nperiod.\\nThere is a paradoxical aspect to these developments. In 1964 we\\ndiscussed at length the possibility that the price of stocks might be\\ntoo high and subject ultimately to a serious decline; but we did not\\nconsider specifically the possibility that the same might happen to\\nthe price of high-grade bonds. (Neither did anyone else that we\\nknow of.) We did warn (on p. 90) that “a long-term bond may vary\\nwidely in price in response to changes in interest rates.” In the light\\nof what has since happened we think that this warning—with\\nattendant examples—was insufficiently stressed.

What course should the investor follow under present con-\\nditions, if we have no strong reason to predict either a significant\\nupward or a significant downward movement for some time in the\\nfuture? First let us point out that if there is no serious adverse\\nchange, the defensive investor should be able to count on the cur-\\nrent 3.5% dividend return on his stocks and also on an average\\nannual appreciation of about 4%. As we shall explain later this\\nappreciation is based essentially on the reinvestment by the vari-\\nous companies of a corresponding amount annually out of undis-\\ntributed profits. On a before-tax basis the combined return of his\\nstocks would then average, say, 7.5%, somewhat less than his inter-\\nest on high-grade bonds.* On an after-tax basis the average return\\non stocks would work out at some 5.3%.5 This would be about the\\nsame as is now obtainable on good tax-free medium-term bonds.\\nThese expectations are much less favorable for stocks against\\nbonds than they were in our 1964 analysis.

(Graham did not specify the time period\\nfor his forecast, but it’s plausible to assume that he was thinking of a 10-\\nyear time horizon.) However, inflation raged at 8.6% annually over this\\nperiod, eating up the entire gain that stocks produced. In this section of his\\nchapter, Graham is summarizing what is known as the “Gordon equation, ”\\nwhich essentially holds that the stock market’s future return is the sum of the\\ncurrent dividend yield plus expected earnings growth. With a dividend yield\\nof just under 2% in early 2003, and long-term earnings growth of around\\n2%, plus inflation at a bit over 2%, a future average annual return of roughly\\n6% is plausible.

Aggressive investors may buy other types of common\\nstocks, but they should be on a definitely attractive basis as estab-\\nlished by intelligent analysis.\\nTo conclude this section, let us mention briefly three supplemen-\\ntary concepts or practices for the defensive investor. The first is the\\npurchase of the shares of well-established investment funds as an\\nalternative to creating his own common-stock portfolio. He might\\nalso utilize one of the “common trust funds,” or “commingled\\nfunds,” operated by trust companies and banks in many states; or,\\nif his funds are substantial, use the services of a recognized invest-\\nment-counsel firm. This will give him professional administration\\nof his investment program along standard lines. The third is the\\ndevice of “dollar-cost averaging,” which means simply that the\\npractitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars\\neach month or each quarter. In this way he buys more shares when\\nthe market is low than when it is high, and he is likely to end up\\nwith a satisfactory overall price for all his holdings. Strictly speak-\\ning, this method is an application of a broader approach known as\\n“formula investing.” The latter was already alluded to in our sug-\\ngestion that the investor may vary his holdings of common stocks\\nbetween the 25% minimum and the 75% maximum, in inverse rela-\\ntionship to the action of the market. These ideas have merit for the\\ndefensive investor, and they will be discussed more amply in later\\nchapters.*\\nResults to Be Expected by the Aggressive Investor\\nOur enterprising security buyer, of course, will desire and\\nexpect to attain better overall results than his defensive or passive\\ncompanion. But first he must make sure that his results will not be\\nworse. It is no difficult trick to bring a great deal of energy, study,\\nand native ability into Wall Street and to end up with losses instead\\nof profits. These virtues, if channeled in the wrong directions,\\nbecome indistinguishable from handicaps. Thus it is most essential\\nthat the enterprising investor start with a clear conception as to\\nInvestment versus Speculation 29\\n* For more advice on “well-established investment funds, ” see Chapter 9.\\n“Professional administration” by “a recognized investment-counsel firm” is\\ndiscussed in Chapter 10. “Dollar-cost averaging” is explained in Chapter 5.'),\n",

These include:\\n1. Trading in the market. This usually means buying stocks\\nwhen the market has been advancing and selling them after it has\\nturned downward. The stocks selected are likely to be among those\\nwhich have been “behaving” better than the market average. A\\nsmall number of professionals frequently engage in short selling.\\nHere they will sell issues they do not own but borrow through the\\nestablished mechanism of the stock exchanges.

Long-term selectivity . Here the usual emphasis is on an\\nexcellent record of past growth, which is considered likely to con-\\ntinue in the future. In some cases also the “investor” may choose\\ncompanies which have not yet shown impressive results, but are\\nexpected to establish a high earning power later. (Such companies\\nbelong frequently in some technological area—e.g., computers,\\ndrugs, electronics—and they often are developing new processes\\nor products that are deemed to be especially promising.)\\nWe have already expressed a negative view about the investor’s\\noverall chances of success in these areas of activity.

He may be wrong in his esti-\\nmate of the future; or even if he is right, the current market price\\nmay already fully reflect what he is anticipating. In the area of\\nnear-term selectivity, the current year’s results of the company are\\ngenerally common property on Wall Street; next year’s results, to\\nthe extent they are predictable, are already being carefully consid-\\nered. Hence the investor who selects issues chiefly on the basis of\\nthis year’s superior results, or on what he is told he may expect for\\nnext year, is likely to find that others have done the same thing for\\nthe same reason.\\nIn choosing stocks for their long-term prospects, the investor’s\\nhandicaps are basically the same.

But that is only theoretical. How many enterprising investors\\ncould count on having the acumen or prophetic gift to beat the pro-\\nfessional analysts at their favorite game of estimating long-term\\nfuture earnings?\\nWe are thus led to the following logical if disconcerting conclu-\\nsion: To enjoy a reasonable chance for continued better than average\\nresults, the investor must follow policies which are (1) inherently\\nsound and promising, and (2) not popular on Wall Street.\\nAre there any such policies available for the enterprising\\ninvestor? In theory once again, the answer should be yes; and there\\nare broad reasons to think that the answer should be affirmative in\\npractice as well. Everyone knows that speculative stock move-\\nments are carried too far in both directions, frequently in the gen-\\neral market and at all times in at least some of the individual\\nissues. Furthermore, a common stock may be undervalued because\\nof lack of interest or unjustified popular prejudice. We can go fur-\\nther and assert that in an astonishingly large proportion of the\\ntrading in common stocks, those engaged therein don’t appear to\\nknow—in polite terms—one part of their anatomy from another.

And selling short a\\ntoo popular and therefore overvalued issue is apt to be a test not\\nonly of one’s courage and stamina but also of the depth of one’s\\npocketbook.* The principle is sound, its successful application is\\nnot impossible, but it is distinctly not an easy art to master.\\nThere is also a fairly wide group of “special situations,” which\\nover many years could be counted on to bring a nice annual return\\nof 20% or better, with a minimum of overall risk to those who knew\\ntheir way around in this field.

The number of\\nsuch deals increased greatly in recent years, and it should have\\nbeen a highly profitable period for the cognoscenti.

That’s because\\nWall Street, like Las Vegas or the racetrack, has calibrated the odds\\nso that the house always prevails, in the end, against everyone who\\ntries to beat the house at its own speculative game.\\nOn the other hand, investing is a unique kind of casino—one where\\nyou cannot lose in the end, so long as you play only by the rules that\\nput the odds squarely in your favor. People who invest make money for\\nthemselves; people who speculate make money for their brokers. And\\nthat, in turn, is why Wall Street perennially downplays the durable\\nvirtues of investing and hypes the gaudy appeal of speculation.\\nUNSAFE AT HIGH SPEED\\nConfusing speculation with investment, Graham warns, is always a\\nmistake. In the 1990s, that confusion led to mass destruction. Almost\\neveryone, it seems, ran out of patience at once, and America became\\nthe Speculation Nation, populated with traders who went shooting\\nfrom stock to stock like grasshoppers whizzing around in an August\\nhay field.\\nPeople began believing that the test of an investment technique\\nwas simply whether it “worked. ” If they beat the market over any\\n36 Commentary on Chapter 1\\n2 Security Analysis, 1934 ed., p. 310.\\n3 As Graham advised in an interview, “Ask yourself: If there was no market\\nfor these shares, would I be willing to have an investment in this company on\\nthese terms?” (Forbes, January 1, 1972, p. 90.)'),\n",

These studies showed that if you piled into\\nsmall stocks in the second half of December and held them into\\nJanuary, you would beat the market by five to 10 percentage\\npoints.

First of all, many investors sell\\ntheir crummiest stocks late in the year to lock in losses that can\\ncut their tax bills. Second, professional money managers grow\\nmore cautious as the year draws to a close, seeking to preserve\\ntheir outperformance (or minimize their underperformance).

All these factors turn small stocks into momentary\\nbargains; when the tax-driven selling ceases in January, they typi-\\ncally bounce back, producing a robust and rapid gain.\\nThe January effect has not withered away, but it has weakened.\\nAccording to finance professor William Schwert of the University of\\nRochester, if you had bought small stocks in late December and\\nsold them in early January, you would have beaten the market by 8.5\\npercentage points from 1962 through 1979, by 4.4 points from\\n1980 through 1989, and by 5.8 points from 1990 through 2001.10\\nAs more people learned about the January effect, more traders\\nbought small stocks in December, making them less of a bargain\\nand thus reducing their returns. Also, the January effect is biggest\\namong the smallest stocks—but according to Plexus Group, the\\nleading authority on brokerage expenses, the total cost of buying\\nand selling such tiny stocks can run up to 8% of your invest-\\nment.11 Sadly, by the time you’re done paying your broker, all your\\ngains on the January effect will melt away.\\n• Just do “what works. ” In 1996, an obscure money manager\\nnamed James O’Shaughnessy published a book called What\\nWorks on Wall Street. In it, he argued that “investors can do\\nmuch better than the market. ” O’Shaughnessy made a stunning\\nclaim: From 1954 through 1994, you could have turned $10,000\\ninto $8,074,504, beating the market by more than 10-fold—a tow-\\nering 18.2% average annual return.

By buying a basket of\\n50 stocks with the highest one-year returns, five straight years of\\nrising earnings, and share prices less than 1.5 times their corpo-\\nrate revenues. 12 As if he were the Edison of Wall Street,\\nO’Shaughnessy obtained U.S. Patent No. 5,978,778 for his “auto-\\nmated strategies” and launched a group of four mutual funds\\nbased on his findings.

Is infla-\\ntion something new for this country, at least in the serious form it\\nhas taken since 1965? If we have seen comparable (or worse) infla-\\ntions in living experience, what lessons can be learned from them\\nin confronting the inflation of today? Let us start with Table 2-1, a\\ncondensed historical tabulation that contains much information\\nabout changes in the general price level and concomitant changes\\nin the earnings and market value of common stocks. Our figures\\nwill begin with 1915, and thus cover 55 years, presented at five-\\nyear intervals. (We use 1946 instead of 1945 to avoid the last year of\\nwartime price controls.)\\nThe first thing we notice is that we have had inflation in the\\npast—lots of it. The largest five-year dose was between 1915 and\\n1920, when the cost of living nearly doubled. This compares with\\nthe advance of 15% between 1965 and 1970. In between, we have\\nhad three periods of declining prices and then six of advances at\\nvarying rates, some rather small. On this showing, the investor\\nshould clearly allow for the probability of continuing or recurrent\\ninflation to come.\\nCan we tell what the rate of inflation is likely to be? No clear\\nanswer is suggested by our table; it shows variations of all sorts. It\\nwould seem sensible, however, to take our cue from the rather con-\\nsistent record of the past 20 years.

(This would compare with an annual rate of\\nabout 21⁄2% for the entire period 1915–1970.)1\\nWhat would be the implications of such an advance? It would\\neat up, in higher living costs, about one-half the income now\\nobtainable on good medium-term tax-free bonds (or our assumed\\nafter-tax equivalent from high-grade corporate bonds). This would\\nbe a serious shrinkage, but it should not be exaggerated. It would\\nnot mean that the true value, or the purchasing power, of the\\ninvestor’s fortune need be reduced over the years. If he spent half\\nhis interest income after taxes he would maintain this buying\\npower intact, even against a 3% annual inflation.\\nBut the next question, naturally, is, “Can the investor be reason-\\nably sure of doing better by buying and holding other things than\\nhigh-grade bonds, even at the unprecedented rate of return offered\\nin 1970–1971?” Would not, for example, an all-stock program be\\npreferable to a part-bond, part-stock program?

The rise of the DJIA from an average of 77 in\\n1915 to an average of 753 in 1970 works out at an annual com-\\npounded rate of just about 4%, to which we may add another 4%\\nfor average dividend return.

This brings us to the next logical\\nquestion: Is there a persuasive reason to believe that common\\nstocks are likely to do much better in future years than they have in\\nthe last five and one-half decades?\\nOur answer to this crucial question must be a flat no. Common\\nstocks may do better in the future than in the past, but they are far\\nfrom certain to do so. We must deal here with two different time\\nelements in investment results. The first covers what is likely to\\noccur over the long-term future—say, the next 25 years. The second\\napplies to what is likely to happen to the investor—both financially\\nand psychologically—over short or intermediate periods, say five\\nyears or less. His frame of mind, his hopes and apprehensions, his\\nsatisfaction or discontent with what he has done, above all his deci-\\nsions what to do next, are all determined not in the retrospect of \\na lifetime of investment but rather by his experience from year \\nto year.\\nOn this point we can be categorical. There is no close time con-\\nnection between inflationary (or deflationary) conditions and the\\nmovement of common-stock earnings and prices. The obvious\\nexample is the recent period, 1966–1970. The rise in the cost of liv-\\ning was 22%, the largest in a five-year period since 1946–1950. But\\nboth stock earnings and stock prices as a whole have declined since\\n1965. There are similar contradictions in both directions in the\\nrecord of previous five-year periods.\\nInflation and Corporate Earnings\\nAnother and highly important approach to the subject is by a\\nstudy of the earnings rate on capital shown by American business.\\nThis has fluctuated, of course, with the general rate of economic\\nactivity, but it has shown no general tendency to advance with\\nwholesale prices or the cost of living. Actually this rate has fallen\\nrather markedly in the past twenty years in spite of the inflation of\\nthe period. (To some degree the decline was due to the charging of\\nmore liberal depreciation rates. See Table 2-2.)

If\\ninflation had operated as a separate favorable factor, its effect\\nwould have been to increase the “value” of previously existing\\ncapital; this in turn should increase the rate of earnings on such old\\ncapital and therefore on the old and new capital combined.

That’s why inflation\\nis so easy to overlook—and why it’s so important to measure your\\ninvesting success not just by what you make, but by how much you\\nkeep after inflation.\\nMore basically still, the intelligent investor must always be on guard\\nagainst whatever is unexpected and underestimated. There are three\\ngood reasons to believe that inflation is not dead:\\n• As recently as 1973–1982, the United States went through one\\nof the most painful bursts of inflation in our history. As measured\\nby the Consumer Price Index, prices more than doubled over \\nthat period, rising at an annualized rate of nearly 9%. In 1979\\nalone, inflation raged at 13.3%, paralyzing the economy in what\\nbecame known as “stagflation”—and leading many commentators\\nto question whether America could compete in the global market-\\nCommentary on Chapter 2 59\\n3 For more insights into this behavioral pitfall, see Eldar Shafir, Peter Dia-\\nmond, and Amos Tversky, “Money Illusion, ” in Daniel Kahneman and Amos\\nTversky, eds., Choices, Values, and Frames (Cambridge University Press,\\n2000), pp. 335–355.'),\n",

No one who lived through it would scoff\\nat such destruction of wealth; no one who is prudent can fail to\\nprotect against the risk that it might recur.\\n• Since 1960, 69% of the world’s market-oriented countries have\\nsuffered at least one year in which inflation ran at an annualized\\nrate of 25% or more. On average, those inflationary periods\\ndestroyed 53% of an investor’s purchasing power.5 We would be\\ncrazy not to hope that America is somehow exempt from such a\\ndisaster.

Vegh, “Modern Hyper-\\nand High Inflations, ” National Bureau of Economic Research, Working Paper\\n8930, at www.nber.org/papers/w8930.\\n6 In fact, the United States has had two periods of hyperinflation. During the\\nAmerican Revolution, prices roughly tripled every year from 1777 through\\n1779, with a pound of butter costing $12 and a barrel of flour fetching\\nnearly $1,600 in Revolutionary Massachusetts. During the Civil War, infla-\\ntion raged at annual rates of 29% (in the North) and nearly 200% (in the\\nConfederacy). As recently as 1946, inflation hit 18.1% in the United States.\\n7 I am indebted to Laurence Siegel of the Ford Foundation for this cynical,\\nbut accurate, insight.

In\\none easy package, you insure yourself against financial loss and the\\nloss of purchasing power.12\\nThere is one catch, however.

(A corresponding chart available for the DJIA will\\nlook very much the same.) The reader will note three quite distinct\\npatterns, each covering about a third of the 70 years. The first runs\\nfrom 1900 to 1924, and shows for the most part a series of rather\\nsimilar market cycles lasting from three to five years. The annual\\nadvance in this period averaged just about 3%.

Similarly, the divi-\\ndend yield on the S & P index had fallen from over 7% in 1949 to\\nonly 3.0% in 1961, a contrast heightened by the fact that interest\\nrates on high-grade bonds had meanwhile risen from 2.60% to\\n4.50%.

The\\nreader may find it informing to review the conclusions we reached\\non these earlier occasions. This is not entirely an exercise in self-\\npunishment. It will supply a sort of connecting tissue that links the\\nvarious stages of the stock market in the past twenty years and also\\na taken-from-life picture of the difficulties facing anyone who tries\\nto reach an informed and critical judgment of current market lev-\\nels. Let us, first, reproduce the summary of the 1948, 1953, and 1959\\nanalyses that we gave in the 1965 edition:\\nIn 1948 we applied conservative standards to the Dow Jones\\nlevel of 180, and found no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that\\n“it was not too high in relation to underlying values.” When we\\napproached this problem in 1953 the average market level for that\\nyear had reached 275, a gain of over 50% in five years. We asked\\nourselves the same question—namely, “whether in our opinion the\\nlevel of 275 for the Dow Jones Industrials was or was not too high\\nfor sound investment.” In the light of the subsequent spectacular\\nadvance, it may seem strange to have to report that it was by no\\nmeans easy for us to reach a definitive conclusion as to the attrac-\\ntiveness of the 1953 level. We did say, positively enough, that\\n“from the standpoint of value indications—our chief investment\\nguide—the conclusion about 1953 stock prices must be favorable.”\\nBut we were concerned about the fact that in 1953, the averages\\nhad advanced for a longer period than in most bull markets of the\\n72 The Intelligent Investor'),\n",

Setting these\\nfactors against our favorable value judgment, we advised a cau-\\ntious or compromise policy. As it turned out, this was not a partic-\\nularly brilliant counsel.

Perhaps we should add in self-defense that few if\\nany of those whose business was stock-market forecasting—as\\nours was not—had any better inkling than we did of what lay\\nahead.\\nAt the beginning of 1959 we found the DJIA at an all-time high\\nof 584. Our lengthy analysis made from all points of view may be\\nsummarized in the following (from page 59 of the 1959 edition):\\n“In sum, we feel compelled to express the conclusion that the pres-\\nent level of stock prices is a dangerous one. It may well be perilous\\nbecause prices are already far too high. But even if this is not the\\ncase the market’s momentum is such as inevitably to carry it to\\nunjustifiable heights. Frankly, we cannot imagine a market of the\\nfuture in which there will never be any serious losses, and in\\nwhich, every tyro will be guaranteed a large profit on his stock\\npurchases.”\\nThe caution we expressed in 1959 was somewhat better justi-\\nfied by the sequel than was our corresponding attitude in 1954. Yet\\nit was far from fully vindicated. The DJIA advanced to 685 in 1961;\\nthen fell a little below our 584 level (to 566) later in the year;\\nadvanced again to 735 in late 1961; and then declined in near panic\\nto 536 in May 1962, showing a loss of 27% within the brief period\\nof six months. At the same time there was a far more serious\\nshrinkage in the most popular “growth stocks”—as evidenced by\\nthe striking fall of the indisputable leader, International Business\\nMachines, from a high of 607 in December 1961 to a low of 300 in\\nJune 1962.\\nThis period saw a complete debacle in a host of newly launched\\ncommon stocks of small enterprises—the so-called hot issues—\\nwhich had been offered to the public at ridiculously high prices\\nand then had been further pushed up by needless speculation to\\nlevels little short of insane. Many of these lost 90% and more of the\\nquotations in just a few months.\\nThe collapse in the first half of 1962 was disconcerting, if not\\ndisastrous, to many self-acknowledged speculators and perhaps \\nA Century of Stock-Market History 73'),\n",

They must weigh\\nour reasoning against the contrary reasoning they will hear from\\nmost competent and experienced people on Wall Street. In the end\\neach one must make his own decision and accept responsibility\\ntherefor. We suggest, however, that if the investor is in doubt as to\\nwhich course to pursue he should choose the path of caution. The\\nprinciples of investment, as set forth herein, would call for the fol-\\nlowing policy under 1964 conditions, in order of urgency:\\n1. No borrowing to buy or hold securities.\\n2. No increase in the proportion of funds held in common stocks.\\n3. A reduction in common-stock holdings where needed to bring\\nit down to a maximum of 50 per cent of the total portfolio. The\\ncapital-gains tax must be paid with as good grace as possible,\\nand the proceeds invested in first-quality bonds or held as a\\nsavings deposit.\\nInvestors who for some time have been following a bona fide\\ndollar-cost averaging plan can in logic elect either to continue their\\nperiodic purchases unchanged or to suspend them until they feel\\nthe market level is no longer dangerous. We should advise rather\\nstrongly against the initiation of a new dollar-averaging plan at the\\nlate 1964 levels, since many investors would not have the stamina\\nto pursue such a scheme if the results soon after initiation should\\nappear highly unfavorable.\\nThis time we can say that our caution was vindicated. The DJIA\\nadvanced about 11% further, to 995, but then fell irregularly to a\\nlow of 632 in 1970, and finished that year at 839. The same kind of\\ndebacle took place in the price of “hot issues”—i.e., with declines\\nrunning as much as 90%—as had happened in the 1961–62 setback.\\nAnd, as pointed out in the Introduction, the whole financial picture\\nappeared to have changed in the direction of less enthusiasm and\\ngreater doubts.

This important indicator, taken by itself, could not be con-\\nstrued to indicate that the market was especially high in January\\n1972. But when the interest yield on high-grade bonds is brought\\ninto the picture, the implications become much less favorable. The\\nreader will note from our table that the ratio of stock returns (earn-\\nings/price) to bond returns has grown worse during the entire\\nperiod, so that the January 1972 figure was less favorable to stocks,\\nby this criterion, than in any of the previous years examined. When\\ndividend yields are compared with bond yields we find that the\\nrelationship was completely reversed between 1948 and 1972. In\\nthe early year stocks yielded twice as much as bonds; now bonds\\nyield twice as much, and more, than stocks.\\nOur final judgment is that the adverse change in the bond-\\nyield/stock-yield ratio fully offsets the better price/earnings ratio\\nfor late 1971, based on the 3-year earnings figures. Hence our view\\nof the early 1972 market level would tend to be the same as it was\\nsome 7 years ago—i.e., that it is an unattractive one from the stand-\\npoint of conservative investment. (This would apply to most of the\\n1971 price range of the DJIA: between, say, 800 and 950.)\\nIn terms of historical market swings the 1971 picture would still\\nappear to be one of irregular recovery from the bad setback suf-\\nfered in 1969–1970. In the past such recoveries have ushered in a\\nnew stage of the recurrent and persistent bull market that began in\\n1949. (This was the expectation of Wall Street generally during\\n1971.) After the terrible experience suffered by the public buyers of\\nlow-grade common-stock offerings in the 1968–1970 cycle, it is too\\nearly (in 1971) for another twirl of the new-issue merry-go-round.\\nHence that dependable sign of imminent danger in the market is\\nlacking now, as it was at the 892 level of the DJIA in November\\n1964, considered in our previous edition. Technically, then, the out-\\nlook would appear to favor another substantial rise far beyond the\\n900 DJIA level before the next serious setback or collapse. But we\\ncannot quite leave the matter there, as perhaps we should. To us,\\nthe early-1971-market’s disregard of the harrowing experiences of\\nless than a year before is a disquieting sign. Can such heedlessness\\ngo unpunished? We think the investor must be prepared for diffi-\\ncult times ahead—perhaps in the form of a fairly quick replay of\\nthe the 1969–1970 decline, or perhaps in the form of another bull-\\nmarket fling, to be followed by a more catastrophic collapse.3\\n78 The Intelligent Investor'),\n",

The bonds are sold at 75% of their\\nface value, and mature at 100% in 5 years 10 months after purchase.\\nIf held to maturity the yield works out at 5%, compounded semi-\\nannually. If redeemed earlier, the yield moves up from a minimum\\nof 4.01% in the first year to an average of 5.20% in the next 45⁄6 years.\\nInterest on the bonds is subject to Federal income tax, but is\\nexempt from state income tax. However, Federal income tax on the\\nSeries E bonds may be paid at the holder’s option either annually\\nas the interest accrues (through higher redemption value), or not\\nuntil the bond is actually disposed of.\\nOwners of Series E bonds may cash them in at any time (shortly\\nafter purchase) at their current redemption value. Holders of Series\\nH bonds have similar rights to cash them in at par value (cost).\\nSeries E bonds are exchangeable for Series H bonds, with certain\\ntax advantages. Bonds lost, destroyed, or stolen may be replaced\\nwithout cost. There are limitations on annual purchases, but liberal\\nprovisions for co-ownership by family members make it possible\\nfor most investors to buy as many as they can afford. Comment:\\nThere is no other investment that combines (1) absolute assurance\\nof principal and interest payments, (2) the right to demand full\\n“money back” at any time, and (3) guarantee of at least a 5% inter-\\nest rate for at least ten years. Holders of the earlier issues of Series\\nE bonds have had the right to extend their bonds at maturity, and\\nthus to continue to accumulate annual values at successively\\nhigher rates. The deferral of income-tax payments over these long\\nperiods has been of great dollar advantage; we calculate it has\\nincreased the effective net-after-tax rate received by as much as a\\nthird in typical cases. Conversely, the right to cash in the bonds at\\ncost price or better has given the purchasers in former years of low\\ninterest rates complete protection against the shrinkage in princi-\\npal value that befell many bond investors; otherwise stated, it gave\\nthem the possibility of benefiting from the rise in interest rates by\\nGeneral Portfolio Policy 93'),\n",

Really good preferred stocks can and do exist,\\nbut they are good in spite of their investment form, which is an\\ninherently bad one. The typical preferred shareholder is dependent\\nfor his safety on the ability and desire of the company to pay divi-\\ndends on its common stock. Once the common dividends are omit-\\nted, or even in danger, his own position becomes precarious, for\\nthe directors are under no obligation to continue paying him unless\\nthey also pay on the common. On the other hand, the typical pre-\\nferred stock carries no share in the company’s profits beyond the\\nfixed dividend rate. Thus the preferred holder lacks both the legal\\nclaim of the bondholder (or creditor) and the profit possibilities of\\na common shareholder (or partner).\\nThese weaknesses in the legal position of preferred stocks tend\\nto come to the fore recurrently in periods of depression. Only a\\nsmall percentage of all preferred issues are so strongly entrenched\\nas to maintain an unquestioned investment status through all vicis-\\nsitudes. Experience teaches that the time to buy preferred stocks is\\nwhen their price is unduly depressed by temporary adversity. (At\\nsuch times they may be well suited to the aggressive investor but\\ntoo unconventional for the defensive investor.)\\nIn other words, they should be bought on a bargain basis or not\\nat all. We shall refer later to convertible and similarly privileged\\nissues, which carry some special possibilities of profits. These are\\nnot ordinarily selected for a conservative portfolio.\\nAnother peculiarity in the general position of preferred stocks\\n98 The Intelligent Investor\\n* A bond’s “coupon” is its interest rate; a “low-coupon” bond pays a rate of\\ninterest income below the market average.'),\n",

They have a much better tax status for corpora-\\ntion buyers than for individual investors. Corporations pay income\\ntax on only 15% of the income they receive in dividends, but on the\\nfull amount of their ordinary interest income. Since the 1972 corpo-\\nrate rate is 48%, this means that $100 received as preferred-stock\\ndividends is taxed only $7.20, whereas $100 received as bond inter-\\nest is taxed $48. On the other hand, individual investors pay\\nexactly the same tax on preferred-stock investments as on bond\\ninterest, except for a recent minor exemption. Thus, in strict logic,\\nall investment-grade preferred stocks should be bought by corpo-\\nrations, just as all tax-exempt bonds should be bought by investors\\nwho pay income tax.*\\nSecurity Forms\\nThe bond form and the preferred-stock form, as hitherto dis-\\ncussed, are well-understood and relatively simple matters. A bond-\\nholder is entitled to receive fixed interest and payment of principal\\non a definite date. The owner of a preferred stock is entitled to a\\nfixed dividend, and no more, which must be paid before any com-\\nmon dividend. His principal value does not come due on any spec-\\nified date. (The dividend may be cumulative or noncumulative. He\\nmay or may not have a vote.)\\nThe above describes the standard provisions and, no doubt, the\\nmajority of bond and preferred issues, but there are innumerable\\ndepartures from these forms. The best-known types are convertible\\nand similar issues, and income bonds. In the latter type, interest\\ndoes not have to be paid unless it is earned by the company.\\n(Unpaid interest may accumulate as a charge against future earn-\\nings, but the period is often limited to three years.)\\nIncome bonds should be used by corporations much more\\nGeneral Portfolio Policy 99\\n* While Graham’s logic remains valid, the numbers have changed.

The first was that they had offered a considerable\\ndegree of protection against the erosion of the investor’s dollar\\ncaused by inflation, whereas bonds offered no protection at all. The\\nsecond advantage of common stocks lay in their higher average\\nreturn to investors over the years. This was produced both by an\\naverage dividend income exceeding the yield on good bonds and\\nby an underlying tendency for market value to increase over the\\nyears in consequence of the reinvestment of undistributed profits.\\nWhile these two advantages have been of major importance—\\nand have given common stocks a far better record than bonds \\nover the long-term past—we have consistently warned that these\\nbenefits could be lost by the stock buyer if he pays too high a price\\nfor his shares. This was clearly the case in 1929, and it took 25 years\\nfor the market level to climb back to the ledge from which it \\nhad abysmally fallen in 1929–1932.* Since 1957 common stocks\\nhave once again, through their high prices, lost their traditional\\nadvantage in dividend yield over bond interest rates.† It remains to\\nThe Defensive Investor and Common Stocks 113\\n* The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a then-record high of 381.17\\non September 3, 1929.

We suggest that this limit be set at 25 times such\\naverage earnings, and not more than 20 times those of the last\\ntwelve-month period. But such a restriction would eliminate\\nnearly all the strongest and most popular companies from the port-\\nfolio. In particular, it would ban virtually the entire category of\\n“growth stocks,” which have for some years past been the favorites\\nof both speculators and institutional investors. We must give our\\nreasons for proposing so drastic an exclusion.\\nGrowth Stocks and the Defensive Investor\\nThe term “growth stock” is applied to one which has increased\\nits per-share earnings in the past at well above the rate for common\\nstocks generally and is expected to continue to do so in the future.\\n(Some authorities would say that a true growth stock should be\\nexpected at least to double its per-share earnings in ten years—i.e.,\\nto increase them at a compounded annual rate of over 7.1%.)†\\nObviously stocks of this kind are attractive to buy and to own, pro-\\nvided the price paid is not excessive. The problem lies there, of\\nThe Defensive Investor and Common Stocks 115\\n* Today’s defensive investor should probably insist on at least 10 years of\\ncontinuous dividend payments (which would eliminate from consideration\\nonly one member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average—Microsoft—and\\nwould still leave at least 317 stocks to choose from among the S & P 500\\nindex). Even insisting on 20 years of uninterrupted dividend payments would\\nnot be overly restrictive; according to Morgan Stanley, 255 companies in\\nthe S & P 500 met that standard as of year-end 2002.\\n† The “Rule of 72” is a handy mental tool. To estimate the length of time an\\namount of money takes to double, simply divide its assumed growth rate\\ninto 72. At 6%, for instance, money will double in 12 years (72 divided by \\n6 = 12). At the 7 .1% rate cited by Graham, a growth stock will double its\\nearnings in just over 10 years (72/7 .1 = 10.1 years).'),\n",

But we have\\nalready pointed out* that this “best of common stocks” actually\\nlost 50% of its market price in a six-months’ decline during 1961–62\\nand nearly the same percentage in 1969–70. Other growth stocks\\nhave been even more vulnerable to adverse developments; in some\\ncases not only has the price fallen back but the earnings as well,\\nthus causing a double discomfiture to those who owned them.

This is an application of a special type\\nof “formula investment” known as dollar-cost averaging. During\\nthe predominantly rising-market experience since 1949 the results\\nfrom such a procedure were certain to be highly satisfactory, espe-\\ncially since they prevented the practitioner from concentrating his\\nbuying at the wrong times.\\nIn Lucile Tomlinson’s comprehensive study of formula invest-\\nment plans, 1 the author presented a calculation of the results of \\ndollar-cost averaging in the group of stocks making up the Dow\\nJones industrial index. Tests were made covering 23 ten-year pur-\\nchase periods, the first ending in 1929, the last in 1952. Every test\\nshowed a profit either at the close of the purchase period or within\\nfive years thereafter. The average indicated profit at the end of the\\n23 buying periods was 21.5%, exclusive of dividends received.\\nNeedless to say, in some instances there was a substantial tempo-\\nrary depreciation at market value. Miss Tomlinson ends her discus-\\nsion of this ultrasimple investment formula with the striking\\nsentence: “No one has yet discovered any other formula for invest-\\ning which can be used with so much confidence of ultimate suc-\\ncess, regardless of what may happen to security prices, as Dollar\\nCost Averaging.”\\nIt may be objected that dollar-cost averaging, while sound in\\nprinciple, is rather unrealistic in practice, because few people are so\\nsituated that they can have available for common-stock investment\\nthe same amount of money each year for, say, 20 years. It seems to\\nme that this apparent objection has lost much of its force in recent\\nyears. Common stocks are becoming generally accepted as a neces-\\nsary component of a sound savings-investment program. Thus,\\nsystematic and uniform purchases of common stocks may present\\nno more psychological and financial difficulties than similar con-\\ntinuous payments for United States savings bonds and for life\\ninsurance—to which they should be complementary. The monthly\\namount may be small, but the results after 20 or more years can be\\nimpressive and important to the saver.\\n118 The Intelligent Investor'),\n",

As concrete examples representing widely\\ndifferent conditions, we shall take: (1) a widow left $200,000 with\\nwhich to support herself and her children; (2) a successful doctor in\\nmid-career, with savings of $100,000 and yearly accretions of\\n$10,000; and (3) a young man earning $200 per week and saving\\n$1,000 a year.*\\nFor the widow, the problem of living on her income is a very dif-\\nficult one. On the other hand the need for conservatism in her\\ninvestments is paramount. A division of her fund about equally\\nbetween United States bonds and first-grade common stocks is a\\ncompromise between these objectives and corresponds to our gen-\\neral prescription for the defensive investor. (The stock component\\nmay be placed as high as 75% if the investor is psychologically pre-\\npared for this decision, and if she can be almost certain she is not\\nbuying at too high a level. Assuredly this is not the case in early\\n1972.)\\nWe do not preclude the possibility that the widow may qualify\\nas an enterprising investor, in which case her objectives and meth-\\nods will be quite different. The one thing the widow must not do is\\nto take speculative chances in order to “make some extra income.”\\nBy this we mean trying for profits or high income without the nec-\\nessary equipment to warrant full confidence in overall success. It\\nwould be far better for her to draw $2,000 per year out of her prin-\\ncipal, in order to make both ends meet, than to risk half of it in\\npoorly grounded, and therefore speculative, ventures.\\nThe prosperous doctor has none of the widow’s pressures and\\ncompulsions, yet we believe that his choices are pretty much the\\nsame.

He has one important handi-\\ncap, however—the fact that he has less time available to give to his\\ninvestment education and to the administration of his funds. In\\nfact, medical men have been notoriously unsuccessful in their secu-\\nrity dealings. The reason for this is that they usually have an ample\\nconfidence in their own intelligence and a strong desire to make a\\ngood return on their money, without the realization that to do so\\nsuccessfully requires both considerable attention to the matter and\\nsomething of a professional approach to security values.\\nFinally, the young man who saves $1,000 a year—and expects to\\ndo better gradually—finds himself with the same choices, though\\nfor still different reasons. Some of his savings should go automati-\\ncally into Series E bonds. The balance is so modest that it seems\\nhardly worthwhile for him to undergo a tough educational and\\ntemperamental discipline in order to qualify as an aggressive\\ninvestor. Thus a simple resort to our standard program for the\\ndefensive investor would be at once the easiest and the most logi-\\ncal policy.\\nLet us not ignore human nature at this point.

From this was derived the popular prejudice against com-\\nmon stocks because they are not “safe,” which was demonstrated\\nin the Federal Reserve Board’s survey of 1948. We should like to\\npoint out that the words “risk” and “safety” are applied to securi-\\nties in two different senses, with a resultant confusion in thought.\\nA bond is clearly proved unsafe when it defaults its interest or\\nprincipal payments. Similarly, if a preferred stock or even a com-\\nmon stock is bought with the expectation that a given rate of divi-\\ndend will be continued, then a reduction or passing of the\\ndividend means that it has proved unsafe. It is also true that an\\ninvestment contains a risk if there is a fair possibility that the\\nholder may have to sell at a time when the price is well below cost.\\nNevertheless, the idea of risk is often extended to apply to a pos-\\nsible decline in the price of a security, even though the decline may\\nbe of a cyclical and temporary nature and even though the holder\\nis unlikely to be forced to sell at such times. These chances are pres-\\nent in all securities, other than United States savings bonds, and to\\na greater extent in the general run of common stocks than in senior\\nissues as a class. But we believe that what is here involved is not a\\ntrue risk in the useful sense of the term. The man who holds a\\nmortgage on a building might have to take a substantial loss if he\\nwere forced to sell it at an unfavorable time. That element is not\\ntaken into account in judging the safety or risk of ordinary real-\\nestate mortgages, the only criterion being the certainty of punctual\\npayments. In the same way the risk attached to an ordinary com-\\nmercial business is measured by the chance of its losing money, not\\nby what would happen if the owner were forced to sell.\\nIn Chapter 8 we shall set forth our conviction that the bona fide\\ninvestor does not lose money merely because the market price of\\nhis holdings declines; hence the fact that a decline may occur does\\nThe Defensive Investor and Common Stocks 121'),\n",

If a group of well-\\nselected common-stock investments shows a satisfactory overall\\nreturn, as measured through a fair number of years, then this\\ngroup investment has proved to be “safe.” During that period its\\nmarket value is bound to fluctuate, and as likely as not it will sell\\nfor a while under the buyer’s cost. If that fact makes the investment\\n“risky,” it would then have to be called both risky and safe at the\\nsame time. This confusion may be avoided if we apply the concept\\nof risk solely to a loss of value which either is realized through\\nactual sale, or is caused by a significant deterioration in the\\ncompany’s position—or, more frequently perhaps, is the result of\\nthe payment of an excessive price in relation to the intrinsic worth\\nof the security.2\\nMany common stocks do involve risks of such deterioration.

Lynch argued that amateur investors have an advantage\\nthat professional investors have forgotten how to use: “the power of\\ncommon knowledge. ” If you discover a great new restaurant, car,\\ntoothpaste, or jeans—or if you notice that the parking lot at a nearby\\nbusiness is always full or that people are still working at a company’s\\nheadquarters long after Jay Leno goes off the air—then you have a per-\\nsonal insight into a stock that a professional analyst or portfolio man-\\nager might never pick up on.

Here the effect of the selling effort is more\\napparent, because most of these issues were probably placed with\\nindividual and inexpert investors. It was characteristic of these\\nofferings that they did not make an adequate showing when\\njudged by the performance of the companies over a sufficient num-\\nber of years. They did look safe enough, for the most part, if it\\ncould be assumed that the recent earnings would continue without\\na serious setback. The investment bankers who brought out these\\nissues presumably accepted this assumption, and their salesmen\\nhad little difficulty in persuading themselves and their customers\\nto a like effect. Nevertheless it was an unsound approach to invest-\\nment, and one likely to prove costly.\\nBull-market periods are usually characterized by the transfor-\\nmation of a large number of privately owned businesses into com-\\npanies with quoted shares. This was the case in 1945–46 and again\\nbeginning in 1960. The process then reached extraordinary propor-\\ntions until brought to a catastrophic close in May 1962. After the\\nusual “swearing-off” period of several years the whole tragicom-\\nedy was repeated, step by step, in 1967–1969.*\\n140 The Intelligent Investor\\n* In the two years from June 1960, through May 1962, more than 850 com-\\npanies sold their stock to the public for the first time—an average of more than\\none per day. In late 1967 the IPO market heated up again; in 1969 an aston-\\nishing 781 new stocks were born. That oversupply helped create the bear\\nmarkets of 1969 and 1973–1974. In 1974 the IPO market was so dead that\\nonly nine new stocks were created all year; 1975 saw only 14 stocks born.\\nThat undersupply, in turn, helped feed the bull market of the 1980s, when\\nroughly 4,000 new stocks flooded the market—helping to trigger the over-'),\n",

Then the cycle swung the other way\\nagain as IPOs dried up in 1988–1990. That shortage contributed to the bull\\nmarket of the 1990s—and, right on cue, Wall Street got back into the busi-\\nness of creating new stocks, cranking out nearly 5,000 IPOs. Then, after the\\nbubble burst in 2000, only 88 IPOs were issued in 2001—the lowest annual\\ntotal since 1979. In every case, the public has gotten burned on IPOs, has\\nstayed away for at least two years, but has always returned for another scald-\\ning. For as long as stock markets have existed, investors have gone through\\nthis manic-depressive cycle. In America’s first great IPO boom, back in 1825,\\na man was said to have been squeezed to death in the stampede of specu-\\nlators trying to buy shares in the new Bank of Southwark; the wealthiest buy-\\ners hired thugs to punch their way to the front of the line. Sure enough, by\\n1829, stocks had lost roughly 25% of their value.\\n* Here Graham is describing rights offerings, in which investors who already\\nown a stock are asked to pony up even more money to maintain the same\\nproportional interest in the company.

(When new money is raised for the business it\\ncomes often via the sale of preferred stock, as previously noted.)\\nThis activity follows a well-defined pattern, which by the nature of\\nthe security markets must bring many losses and disappointments\\nto the public. The dangers arise both from the character of the\\nbusinesses that are thus financed and from the market conditions\\nthat make the financing possible.\\nIn the early part of the century a large proportion of our leading\\ncompanies were introduced to public trading. As time went on, the\\nnumber of enterprises of first rank that remained closely held\\nsteadily diminished; hence original common-stock flotations have\\ntended to be concentrated more and more on relatively small con-\\ncerns. By an unfortunate correlation, during the same period the\\nstock-buying public has been developing an ingrained preference\\nfor the major companies and a similar prejudice against the minor\\nones. This prejudice, like many others, tends to become weaker as\\nbull markets are built up; the large and quick profits shown by\\ncommon stocks as a whole are sufficient to dull the public’s critical\\nfaculty, just as they sharpen its acquisitive instinct. During these\\nperiods, also, quite a number of privately owned concerns can be\\nfound that are enjoying excellent results—although most of these\\nwould not present too impressive a record if the figures were car-\\nried back, say, ten years or more.\\nWhen these factors are put together the following consequences\\nemerge: Somewhere in the middle of the bull market the first \\ncommon-stock flotations make their appearance. These are priced\\nnot unattractively, and some large profits are made by the buyers of\\nthe early issues. As the market rise continues, this brand of financing\\ngrows more frequent; the quality of the companies becomes steadily\\npoorer; the prices asked and obtained verge on the exorbitant. One\\nfairly dependable sign of the approaching end of a bull swing is the\\nfact that new common stocks of small and nondescript companies\\nare offered at prices somewhat higher than the current level for\\nmany medium-sized companies with a long market history.

Perhaps the aggressive investor should start with\\nthe “low-multiplier” idea, but add other quantitative and qualita-\\ntive requirements thereto in making up his portfolio.\\nPurchase of Bargain Issues\\nWe define a bargain issue as one which, on the basis of facts\\nestablished by analysis, appears to be worth considerably more\\nthan it is selling for. The genus includes bonds and preferred stocks\\nselling well under par, as well as common stocks. To be as concrete\\nas possible, let us suggest that an issue is not a true “bargain”\\nunless the indicated value is at least 50% more than the price. What\\nkind of facts would warrant the conclusion that so great a discrep-\\nancy exists? How do bargains come into existence, and how does\\nthe investor profit from them?\\nThere are two tests by which a bargain common stock is\\ndetected. The first is by the method of appraisal. This relies largely\\non estimating future earnings and then multiplying these by a fac-\\ntor appropriate to the particular issue. If the resultant value is suffi-\\nciently above the market price—and if the investor has confidence\\nin the technique employed—he can tag the stock as a bargain. The\\nsecond test is the value of the business to a private owner. This\\nvalue also is often determined chiefly by expected future earn-\\nings—in which case the result may be identical with the first. But in\\nthe second test more attention is likely to be paid to the realizable\\nvalue of the assets, with particular emphasis on the net current\\nassets or working capital.\\nAt low points in the general market a large proportion of com-\\nmon stocks are bargain issues, as measured by these standards. (A\\ntypical example was General Motors when it sold at less than 30 in\\n1941, equivalent to only 5 for the 1971 shares. It had been earning\\nin excess of $4 and paying $3.50, or more, in dividends.)

The market is\\nfond of making mountains out of molehills and exaggerating ordi-\\nnary vicissitudes into major setbacks.* Even a mere lack of interest\\nor enthusiasm may impel a price decline to absurdly low levels.\\nThus we have what appear to be two major sources of undervalua-\\ntion: (1) currently disappointing results and (2) protracted neglect\\nor unpopularity.\\nHowever, neither of these causes, if considered by itself alone,\\ncan be relied on as a guide to successful common-stock investment.\\nHow can we be sure that the currently disappointing results are\\nindeed going to be only temporary? True, we can supply excellent\\nexamples of that happening. The steel stocks used to be famous \\nfor their cyclical quality, and the shrewd buyer could acquire \\nthem at low prices when earnings were low and sell them out in\\nboom years at a fine profit. A spectacular example is supplied by\\nChrysler Corporation, as shown by the data in Table 7-3.\\nIf this were the standard behavior of stocks with fluctuating\\nearnings, then making profits in the stock market would be an easy\\nmatter.

He should require an indi-\\ncation of at least reasonable stability of earnings over the past\\ndecade or more—i.e., no year of earnings deficit—plus sufficient\\nsize and financial strength to meet possible setbacks in the future.\\nThe ideal combination here is thus that of a large and prominent\\ncompany selling both well below its past average price and its past\\naverage price/earnings multiplier.

A current case of\\nthis kind would appear to be National Presto Industries. In the bull\\nmarket of 1968 it sold at a high of 45, which was only 8 times the\\n$5.61 earnings for that year.

By way of exception, any company that has established\\nitself as a growth stock is not ordinarily considered “secondary.”\\nIn the great bull market of the 1920s relatively little distinction\\nwas drawn between industry leaders and other listed issues, pro-\\nvided the latter were of respectable size.

In\\nfact, at least subconsciously, they calculated that any price was too\\nhigh for them because they were heading for extinction—just as in\\n1929 the companion theory for the “blue chips” was that no price\\nwas too high for them because their future possibilities were limit-\\nless. Both of these views were exaggerations and were productive\\nof serious investment errors. Actually, the typical middle-sized\\nlisted company is a large one when compared with the average pri-\\nvately owned business. There is no sound reason why such compa-\\nnies should not continue indefinitely in operation, undergoing the\\nvicissitudes characteristic of our economy but earning on the\\nwhole a fair return on their invested capital.\\nThis brief review indicates that the stock market’s attitude\\ntoward secondary companies tends to be unrealistic and conse-\\nquently to create in normal times innumerable instances of major\\nundervaluation. As it happens, the World War II period and the\\npostwar boom were more beneficial to the smaller concerns than to\\nthe larger ones, because then the normal competition for sales was\\nsuspended and the former could expand sales and profit margins\\nmore spectacularly. Thus by 1946 the market’s pattern had com-\\npletely reversed itself from that before the war. Whereas the lead-\\ning stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average had advanced only\\n40% from the end of 1938 to the 1946 high, Standard & Poor’s index\\nof low-priced stocks had shot up no less than 280% in the same\\nperiod.

In a different way this phenomenon was\\nrepeated in 1961 and 1968—the emphasis now being placed on\\nnew offerings of the shares of small companies of less than second-\\nary character, and on nearly all companies in certain favored fields\\nsuch as “electronics,” “computers,” “franchise” concerns, and oth-\\ners.*\\nAs was to be expected the ensuing market declines fell most\\nheavily on these overvaluations. In some cases the pendulum\\nswing may have gone as far as definite undervaluation.\\nIf most secondary issues tend normally to be undervalued, what\\nreason has the investor to believe that he can profit from such a sit-\\nuation? For if it persists indefinitely, will he not always be in the\\nsame market position as when he bought the issue? The answer\\nhere is somewhat complicated. Substantial profits from the pur-\\nchase of secondary companies at bargain prices arise in a variety of\\nways. First, the dividend return is relatively high. Second, the rein-\\nvested earnings are substantial in relation to the price paid and will\\nultimately affect the price. In a five- to seven-year period these\\nadvantages can bulk quite large in a well-selected list. Third, a bull\\nmarket is ordinarily most generous to low-priced issues; thus it\\ntends to raise the typical bargain issue to at least a reasonable level.\\nFourth, even during relatively featureless market periods a contin-\\nuous process of price adjustment goes on, under which secondary\\nissues that were undervalued may rise at least to the normal level\\nfor their type of security.

In these cases the consideration paid has almost\\nalways been relatively generous, and much in excess of the bargain\\nlevels existing not long before.\\nWhen interest rates were much lower than in 1970, the field of\\nbargain issues extended to bonds and preferred stocks that sold at\\nlarge discounts from the amount of their claim. Currently we have\\na different situation in which even well-secured issues sell at large\\ndiscounts if carrying coupon rates of, say, 4 1⁄2% or less. Example:\\nAmerican Telephone & Telegraph 25⁄8s, due 1986, sold as low as 51\\nin 1970; Deere & Co. 4 1⁄2s, due 1983, sold as low as 62.

For a\\nbargain bond issue in the more traditional sense perhaps we shall\\nhave to turn once more to the first-mortgage bonds of railroads\\nnow in financial difficulties, which sell in the 20s or 30s. Such situa-\\ntions are not for the inexpert investor; lacking a real sense of values\\nin this area, he may burn his fingers. But there is an underlying ten-\\ndency for market decline in this field to be overdone; consequently\\nthe group as a whole offers an especially rewarding invitation to\\ncareful and courageous analysis.

They do not have the\\ntime, or the determination, or the mental equipment to embark\\nupon investing as a quasi-business. They should therefore be satis-\\nfied with the excellent return now obtainable from a defensive\\nportfolio (and with even less), and they should stoutly resist the\\nrecurrent temptation to increase this return by deviating into other\\npaths.\\nThe enterprising investor may properly embark upon any secu-\\nrity operation for which his training and judgment are adequate\\nand which appears sufficiently promising when measured by estab-\\nlished business standards.\\nIn our recommendations and caveats for this group of investors\\nwe have attempted to apply such business standards. In those for\\nthe defensive investor we have been guided largely by the three\\nrequirements of underlying safety, simplicity of choice, and prom-\\nise of satisfactory results, in terms of psychology as well as arith-\\nmetic. The use of these criteria has led us to exclude from the field\\nof recommended investment a number of security classes that are\\nnormally regarded as suitable for various kinds of investors. These\\nprohibitions were listed in our first chapter on p. 30.\\nLet us consider a little more fully than before what is implied in\\nthese exclusions. We have advised against the purchase at “full\\nprices” of three important categories of securities: (1) foreign\\nbonds, (2) ordinary preferred stocks, and (3) secondary common\\nstocks, including, of course, original offerings of such issues. By\\n“full prices” we mean prices close to par for bonds or preferred\\nstocks, and prices that represent about the fair business value of\\nthe enterprise in the case of common stocks. The greater number \\nof defensive investors are to avoid these categories regardless of\\nprice; the enterprising investor is to buy them only when obtain-\\n176 The Intelligent Investor'),\n",

If the majority of\\ninvestors, being in the defensive class, are not to buy them at all,\\nthe field of possible buyers becomes seriously restricted. Further-\\nmore, if aggressive investors are to buy them only at bargain levels,\\nthen these issues would be doomed to sell for less than their fair\\nvalue, except to the extent that they were purchased unintelli-\\ngently.\\nThis may sound severe and even vaguely unethical. Yet in truth\\nwe are merely recognizing what has actually happened in this area\\nfor the greater part of the past 40 years. Secondary issues, for the\\nmost part, do fluctuate about a central level which is well below\\ntheir fair value. They reach and even surpass that value at times;\\nbut this occurs in the upper reaches of bull markets, when the les-\\nsons of practical experience would argue against the soundness of\\npaying the prevailing prices for common stocks.\\nThus we are suggesting only that the aggressive investor recog-\\nnize the facts of life as it is lived by secondary issues and that they\\naccept the central market levels that are normal for that class as\\ntheir guide in fixing their own levels for purchase.\\nThere is a paradox here, nevertheless. The average well-selected\\nsecondary company may be fully as promising as the average\\nindustrial leader. What the smaller concern lacks in inherent stabil-\\nity it may readily make up in superior possibilities of growth. Con-\\nsequently it may appear illogical to many readers to term\\n“unintelligent” the purchase of such secondary issues at their full\\n“enterprise value.” We think that the strongest logic is that of expe-\\nrience. Financial history says clearly that the investor may expect\\nsatisfactory results, on the average, from secondary common\\nstocks only if he buys them for less than their value to a private\\nowner, that is, on a bargain basis.\\nPortfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side 177'),\n",

He enjoys an advan-\\ntage only if by waiting he succeeds in buying later at a sufficiently\\nlower priceto offset his loss of dividend income. What this means is\\nthat timing is of no real value to the investor unless it coincides\\nwith pricing—that is, unless it enables him to repurchase his shares\\nat substantially under his previous selling price.\\nIn this respect the famous Dow theory for timing purchases and\\nsales has had an unusual history.* Briefly, this technique takes its\\nsignal to buy from a special kind of “breakthrough” of the stock\\naverages on the up side, and its selling signal from a similar break-\\nthrough on the down side.

Six of these took no longer than four years, four\\nran for six or seven years, and one—the famous “new-era” cycle of\\n1921–1932—lasted eleven years.

Either issue will give him a 5% yield (after the first\\nyear), the Series E for up to 55⁄6 years, the Series H for up to ten\\nyears, with a guaranteed resale value of cost or better.\\nIf the investor wants the 7.5% now available on good long-term\\ncorporate bonds, or the 5.3% on tax-free municipals, he must be\\nprepared to see them fluctuate in price.

A good many of the convertible issues have been sold by\\ncompanies that have credit ratings well below the best. 3 Some of\\nthese were badly affected by the financial squeeze in 1970.

One possibility would be to\\nsell long-term bonds with interest payments that vary with an\\nappropriate index of the going rate. The main results of such an\\narrangement would be: (1) the investor’s bond would always have\\na principal value of about 100, if the company maintains its credit\\nrating, but the interest received will vary, say, with the rate offered\\non conventional new issues; (2) the corporation would have the\\nadvantages of long-term debt—being spared problems and costs of\\nfrequent renewals of refinancing—but its interest costs would\\nchange from year to year.4\\nOver the past decade the bond investor has been confronted by\\nan increasingly serious dilemma: Shall he choose complete stability\\nof principal value, but with varying and usually low (short-term)\\ninterest rates?

It would be good for most investors if they could \\ncompromise between these extremes, and be assured that neither\\ntheir interest return nor their principal value will fall below a\\nstated minimum over, say, a 20-year period. This could be\\narranged, without great difficulty, in an appropriate bond contract\\nof a new form. Important note: In effect the U.S. government has\\ndone a similar thing in its combination of the original savings-\\nbonds contracts with their extensions at higher interest rates.

If Inktomi could sustain its growth\\nrate of the previous 12 months for just five more years, its revenues\\nwould explode from $36 million a quarter to $5 billion a month. With\\nsuch growth in sight, the faster the stock went up, the farther up it\\nseemed certain to go.\\nBut in his wild love affair with Inktomi’s stock, Mr. Market was over-\\nlooking something about its business. The company was losing\\nmoney—lots of it. It had lost $6 million in the most recent quarter, $24\\nmillion in the 12 months before that, and $24 million in the year before\\nthat. In its entire corporate lifetime, Inktomi had never made a dime in\\nprofits. Yet, on March 17 , 2000, Mr. Market valued this tiny business at\\na total of $25 billion. (Yes, that’s billion, with a B.)\\nAnd then Mr. Market went into a sudden, nightmarish depression.\\nOn September 30, 2002, just two and a half years after hitting\\n$231.625 per share, Inktomi’s stock closed at 25 cents—collapsing\\nfrom a total market value of $25 billion to less than $40 million. Had\\nInktomi’s business dried up? Not at all; over the previous 12 months,\\nthe company had generated $113 million in revenues. So what had\\nchanged? Only Mr. Market’s mood: In early 2000, investors were \\nso wild about the Internet that they priced Inktomi’s shares at 250\\ntimes the company’s revenues. Now, however, they would pay only\\n0.35 times its revenues. Mr. Market had morphed from Dr. Jekyll to Mr.\\nHyde and was ferociously trashing every stock that had made a fool\\nout of him.\\nBut Mr. Market was no more justified in his midnight rage than he\\nhad been in his manic euphoria. On December 23, 2002, Yahoo! Inc.\\nannounced that it would buy Inktomi for $1.65 per share. That was\\nnearly seven times Inktomi’s stock price on September 30.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Code allows you to use your\\nrealized losses (any declines in value that you lock in by selling your\\nshares) to offset up to $3,000 in ordinary income. 12 Let’s say you\\nbought 200 shares of Coca-Cola stock in January 2000 for $60 a\\nshare—a total investment of $12,000. By year-end 2002, the stock\\nwas down to $44 a share, or $8,800 for your lot—a loss of $3,200.\\nYou could have done what most people do—either whine about\\nyour loss, or sweep it under the rug and pretend it never happened.\\nOr you could have taken control. Before 2002 ended, you could have\\nsold all your Coke shares, locking in the $3,200 loss. Then, after wait-\\ning 31 days to comply with IRS rules, you would buy 200 shares of\\nCoke all over again. The result: You would be able to reduce your tax-\\nable income by $3,000 in 2002, and you could use the remaining\\n$200 loss to offset your income in 2003. And better yet, you would\\nstill own a company whose future you believe in—but now you would\\nown it for almost one-third less than you paid the first time.13\\nWith Uncle Sam subsidizing your losses, it can make sense to sell\\nand lock in a loss.

Most of these are actively\\nselling additional shares through a corps of salesmen. Those with\\nnonredeemable shares are called “closed-end” companies or funds;\\nthe number of their shares remains relatively constant. All of the\\nfunds of any importance are registered with the Securities &\\nExchange Commission (SEC), and are subject to its regulations and\\ncontrols.*\\nThe industry is a very large one. At the end of 1970 there were\\n383 funds registered with the SEC, having assets totaling $54.6 bil-\\nlions. Of these 356 companies, with $50.6 billions, were mutual\\nfunds, and 27 companies with $4.0 billions, were closed-end.†\\nThere are different ways of classifying the funds. One is by the\\nbroad division of their portfolio; they are “balanced funds” if they\\nhave a significant (generally about one-third) component of bonds,\\nor “stock-funds” if their holdings are nearly all common stocks.\\n(There are some other varieties here, such as “bond funds,” “hedge\\n226\\n* It is a violation of Federal law for an open-end mutual fund, a closed-end\\nfund, or an exchange-traded fund to sell shares to the public unless it has\\n“registered” (or made mandatory financial filings) with the SEC.\\n† The fund industry has gone from “very large” to immense.

Since they cannot pay salesmen’s commissions,\\nthe size of the no-load funds tends to be on the low side.† The buy-\\ning and selling prices of the closed-end funds are not fixed by the\\ncompanies, but fluctuate in the open market as does the ordinary\\ncorporate stock.\\nMost of the companies operate under special provisions of the\\nincome-tax law, designed to relieve the shareholders from double\\ntaxation on their earnings. In effect, the funds must pay out vir-\\ntually all their ordinary income—i.e., dividends and interest\\nreceived, less expenses. In addition they can pay out their realized\\nlong-term profits on sales of investments—in the form of “capital-\\ngains dividends”—which are treated by the shareholder as if they\\nwere his own security profits.

Has\\nit done a good job for its shareholders? In the most general way,\\nhow have fund investors fared as against those who made their\\ninvestments directly? We are quite certain that the funds in the\\naggregate have served a useful purpose. They have promoted\\ngood habits of savings and investment; they have protected count-\\nless individuals against costly mistakes in the stock market; they\\nhave brought their participants income and profits commensurate\\nwith the overall returns from common stocks.

More likely his choice has been between succumbing to\\nthe wiles of the doorbell-ringing mutual-fund salesman on the one\\nhand, as against succumbing to the even wilier and much more\\ndangerous peddlers of second- and third-rate new offerings. We\\ncannot help thinking, too, that the average individual who opens a\\nbrokerage account with the idea of making conservative common-\\nstock investments is likely to find himself beset by untoward influ-\\nences in the direction of speculation and speculative losses; these\\ntemptations should be much less for the mutual-fund buyer.\\nBut how have the investment funds performed as against the\\ngeneral market?

Thus they should be fairly representative\\nof the industry as a whole. (In theory, there should be a bias in this\\nlist on the side of better than industry performance, since these bet-\\nter companies should have been entitled to more rapid expansion\\nthan the others; but this may not be the case in practice.)\\nSome interesting facts can be gathered from this table. First, we\\nfind that the overall results of these ten funds for 1961–1970 were\\nnot appreciably different from those of the Standard & Poor’s 500-\\nstock composite average (or the S & P 425-industrial stock aver-\\nage).

The funds’ gain ran a little lower than S & P’s in\\n1961–1965 and a little higher than S & P’s in 1966–1970. The third\\npoint is that a wide difference exists between the results of the indi-\\nvidual funds.\\nWe do not think the mutual-fund industry can be criticized for\\ndoing no better than the market as a whole. Their managers and\\ntheir professional competitors administer so large a portion of all\\nmarketable common stocks that what happens to the market as a\\nwhole must necessarily happen (approximately) to the sum of their\\nfunds. (Note that the trust assets of insured commercial banks\\nincluded $181 billion of common stocks at the end of 1969; if we\\nadd to this the common stocks in accounts handled by investment\\nadvisers, plus the $56 billion of mutual and similar funds, we must\\nconclude that the combined decisions of these professionals pretty\\nwell determine the movements of the stock averages, and that the\\nInvesting in Investment Funds 231\\n* For periods as long as 10 years, the returns of the Dow and the S & P 500\\ncan diverge by fairly wide margins.

Why\\nshouldn’t the investor find out what fund has made the best show-\\ning of the lot over a period of sufficient years in the past, assume\\nfrom this that its management is the most capable and will there-\\nfore do better than average in the future, and put his money in that\\nfund?

The conflict of\\ninterest between what’s best for the fund’s managers and what’s best\\nfor its investors is mitigated when the managers are among the\\nbiggest owners of the fund’s shares. Some firms, like Longleaf Part-\\nners, even forbid their employees from owning anything but their own\\nfunds. At Longleaf and other firms like Davis and FPA, the managers\\nown so much of the funds that they are likely to manage your money\\nas if it were their own—lowering the odds that they will jack up fees, let\\nthe funds swell to gargantuan size, or whack you with a nasty tax bill. A\\nfund’s proxy statement and Statement of Additional Information, both\\navailable from the Securities and Exchange Commission through the\\nEDGAR database at www.sec.gov, disclose whether the managers\\nown at least 1% of the fund’s shares.\\nThey are cheap. One of the most common myths in the fund busi-\\nness is that “you get what you pay for”—that high returns are the best\\njustification for higher fees. There are two problems with this argu-\\nment. First, it isn’t true; decades of research have proven that funds\\nwith higher fees earn lower returns over time. Secondly, high returns\\nare temporary, while high fees are nearly as permanent as granite. If\\nyou buy a fund for its hot returns, you may well end up with a handful\\nof cold ashes—but your costs of owning the fund are almost certain\\nnot to decline when its returns do.\\nThey dare to be different.When Peter Lynch ran Fidelity Magellan, he\\nbought whatever seemed cheap to him—regardless of what other fund\\nmanagers owned. In 1982, his biggest investment was Treasury bonds;\\nright after that, he made Chrysler his top holding, even though most\\nexperts expected the automaker to go bankrupt; then, in 1986, Lynch put\\nalmost 20% of Fidelity Magellan in foreign stocks like Honda, Norsk\\nHydro, and Volvo.

That is their own bailiwick.\\nWhen they, or nonbusiness people, rely on others to make invest-\\nment profits for them, they are expecting a kind of result for which\\nthere is no true counterpart in ordinary business affairs.\\nIf we assume that there are normal or standard income results to\\nbe obtained from investing money in securities, then the role of the\\nadviser can be more readily established. He will use his superior\\ntraining and experience to protect his clients against mistakes and\\nto make sure that they obtain the results to which their money is\\nentitled. It is when the investor demands more than an average\\nreturn on his money, or when his adviser undertakes to do better\\nfor him, that the question arises whether more is being asked or\\npromised than is likely to be delivered.\\nAdvice on investments may be obtained from a variety of\\nsources. These include: (1) a relative or friend, presumably knowl-\\nedgeable in securities; (2) a local (commercial) banker; (3) a broker-\\nage firm or investment banking house; (4) a financial service or\\n257'),\n",

For many decades the New York Stock Exchange has been\\nmoving in the direction of closer and stricter controls over the\\noperations and financial condition of its members—including min-\\nimum capital requirements, surprise audits, and the like. Besides\\nthis, we have had 37 years of control over the exchanges and their\\nmembers by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Finally, \\nthe stock-brokerage industry itself has operated under favorable\\nconditions—namely, a huge increase in volume, fixed minimum\\ncommission rates (largely eliminating competitive fees), and a lim-\\nited number of member firms.\\nThe first financial troubles of the brokerage houses (in 1969)\\nwere attributed to the increase in volume itself. This, it was\\nclaimed, overtaxed their facilities, increased their overhead, and\\nproduced many troubles in making financial settlements. It should\\nbe pointed out this was probably the first time in history that\\nimportant enterprises have gone broke because they had more\\nbusiness than they could handle. In 1970, as brokerage failures\\nincreased, they were blamed chiefly on “the falling off in volume.”\\nA strange complaint when one reflects that the turnover of the\\n266 The Intelligent Investor\\n* The two firms Graham had in mind were probably Du Pont, Glore, Forgan\\n& Co. and Goodbody & Co.

Investment history shows that bonds and pre-\\nferred stocks that have met stringent tests of safety, based on the\\npast, have in the great majority of cases been able to face the vicissi-\\ntudes of the future successfully.

In nearly every case the roads that got into trouble had long\\nbeen overbonded, had shown an inadequate coverage of fixed\\ncharges in periods of average prosperity, and would thus have been\\nruled out by investors who applied strict tests of safety. Conversely,\\npractically every road that has met such tests has escaped financial\\nembarrassment.

No one really knows anything\\nabout what will happen in the distant future, but analysts and\\ninvestors have strong views on the subject just the same. These\\nviews are reflected in the substantial differentials between the\\nprice/earnings ratios of individual companies and of industry\\ngroups. At this point we added in our 1965 edition:\\nFor example, at the end of 1963 the chemical companies in the\\nDJIA were selling at considerably higher multipliers than the oil\\ncompanies, indicating stronger confidence in the prospects of the\\nformer than of the latter. Such distinctions made by the market are\\noften soundly based, but when dictated mainly by past perfor-\\nmance they are as likely to be wrong as right.\\nWe shall supply here, in Table 11-3, the 1963 year-end material\\non the chemical and oil company issues in the DJIA, and carry their\\nearnings to the end of 1970. It will be seen that the chemical compa-\\nnies, despite their high multipliers, made practically no gain in\\nearnings in the period after 1963. The oil companies did much bet-\\nter than the chemicals and about in line with the growth implied in\\ntheir 1963 multipliers.5 Thus our chemical-stock example proved to\\nbe one of the cases in which the market multipliers were proven\\nwrong.*\\nSecurity Analysis for the Lay Investor 291\\n* Graham’s point about chemical and oil companies in the 1960s applies to\\nnearly every industry in nearly every time period. Wall Street’s consensus\\nview of the future for any given sector is usually either too optimistic or too\\npessimistic. Worse, the consensus is at its most cheery just when the\\nstocks are most overpriced—and gloomiest just when they are cheapest.\\nThe most recent example, of course, is technology and telecommunications\\nstocks, which hit record highs when their future seemed brightest in 1999\\nand early 2000, and then crashed all the way through 2002.

Management. On Wall Street a great deal is constantly said on\\nthis subject, but little that is really helpful. Until objective, quantita-\\ntive, and reasonably reliable tests of managerial competence are\\ndevised and applied, this factor will continue to be looked at\\nthrough a fog. It is fair to assume that an outstandingly successful\\ncompany has unusually good management. This will have shown\\nitself already in the past record; it will show up again in the esti-\\nmates for the next five years, and once more in the previously dis-\\ncussed factor of long-term prospects.

The second happened as\\nrecently as 1962, when Chrysler had fallen far from its once high\\nestate and the stock was selling at its lowest price in many years.\\nThen new interests, associated with Consolidation Coal, took over\\nthe reins. The earnings advanced from the 1961 figure of $1.24 per\\nshare to the equivalent of $17 in 1963, and the price rose from a low\\nof 381⁄2 in 1962 to the equivalent of nearly 200 the very next year.6\\n3.

We think that a record of continuous dividend\\npayments for the last 20 years or more is an important plus factor\\nin the company’s quality rating. Indeed the defensive investor\\nmight be justified in limiting his purchases to those meeting this\\ntest.\\n5. Current Dividend Rate. This, our last additional factor, is the\\nmost difficult one to deal with in satisfactory fashion. Fortunately,\\nthe majority of companies have come to follow what may be called\\na standard dividend policy. This has meant the distribution of\\nabout two-thirds of their average earnings, except that in the recent\\nperiod of high profits and inflationary demands for more capital\\nthe figure has tended to be lower. (In 1969 it was 59.5% for the\\nstocks in the Dow Jones average, and 55% for all American corpo-\\nrations.)* Where the dividend bears a normal relationship to the\\nearnings, the valuation may be made on either basis without sub-\\nstantially affecting the result. For example, a typical secondary\\ncompany with expected average earnings of $3 and an expected\\ndividend of $2 may be valued at either 12 times its earnings or 18\\ntimes its dividend, to yield a value of 36 in both cases.\\nHowever, an increasing number of growth companies are\\ndeparting from the once standard policy of paying out 60% or\\nmore of earnings in dividends, on the grounds that the sharehold-\\n294 The Intelligent Investor\\n* This figure, now known as the “dividend payout ratio, ” has dropped consid-\\nerably since Graham’s day as American tax law discouraged investors from\\nseeking, and corporations from paying, dividends.

Our study of the various\\nmethods has led us to suggest a foreshortened and quite simple\\nformula for the valuation of growth stocks, which is intended to\\nproduce figures fairly close to those resulting from the more\\nrefined mathematical calculations. Our formula is:\\nValue = Current (Normal) Earnings /H11003(8.5 plus twice \\nthe expected annual growth rate)\\nThe growth figure should be that expected over the next seven to\\nten years.7\\nIn Table 11-4 we show how our formula works out for various\\nrates of assumed growth. It is easy to make the converse calcula-\\ntion and to determine what rate of growth is anticipated by the cur-\\nrent market price, assuming our formula is valid. In our last\\nedition we made that calculation for the DJIA and for six important\\nstock issues. These figures are reproduced in Table 11-5. We com-\\nmented at the time:\\nThe difference between the implicit 32.4% annual growth rate\\nfor Xerox and the extremely modest 2.8% for General Motors is\\nindeed striking. It is explainable in part by the stock market’s feel-\\ning that General Motors’ 1963 earnings—the largest for any corpo-\\nration in history—can be maintained with difficulty and exceeded\\nonly modestly at best. The price earnings ratio of Xerox, on the\\nother hand, is quite representative of speculative enthusiasm fas-\\ntened upon a company of great achievement and perhaps still\\ngreater promise.\\nThe implicit or expected growth rate of 5.1% for the DJIA com-\\nSecurity Analysis for the Lay Investor 295'),\n",

In fact, according to the arithmetic, if a company could be\\nassumed to grow at a rate of 8% or more indefinitely in the future its\\nvalue would be infinite, and no price would be too high to pay for\\nthe shares. What the valuer actually does in these cases is to intro-\\nduce a margin of safety into his calculations—somewhat as an engi-\\nneer does in his specifications for a structure. On this basis the\\npurchases would realize his assigned objective (in 1963, a future\\noverall return of 7 1⁄2% per annum) even if the growth rate actually\\nrealized proved substantially less than that projected in the for-\\nmula. Of course, then, if that rate were actually realized the\\ninvestor would be sure to enjoy a handsome additional return.\\nThere is really no way of valuing a high-growth company (with \\nan expected rate above, say, 8% annually), in which the analyst \\ncan make realistic assumptions of both the proper multiplier for \\nthe current earnings and the expectable multiplier for the future\\nearnings.\\nAs it happened the actual growth for Xerox and IBM proved\\nvery close to the high rates implied from our formula. As just\\nexplained, this fine showing inevitably produced a large advance\\nin the price of both issues. The growth of the DJIA itself was also\\nabout as projected by the 1963 closing market price. But the moder-\\nate rate of 5% did not involve the mathematical dilemma of Xerox\\nand IBM.

And, in earlier days, a\\ncompany that drastically diluted its shares (with large amounts of convert-\\nible debt or multiple offerings of common stock) was said to have “watered”\\nits stock. This term is believed to have originated with the legendary market\\nmanipulator Daniel Drew (1797–1879), who began as a livestock trader. He\\nwould drive his cattle south toward Manhattan, force-feeding them salt\\nalong the way. When they got to the Harlem River, they would guzzle huge\\nvolumes of water to slake their thirst. Drew would then bring them to market,\\nwhere the water they had just drunk would increase their weight. That\\nenabled him to get a much higher price, since cattle on the hoof is sold by\\nthe pound.

The first is that by anticipating\\nfuture losses the company escapes the necessity of allocating the\\nlosses themselves to an identifiable year. They don’t belong in\\n1970, because they were not actually taken in that year. And they\\nwon’t be shown in the year when they are actually taken, because\\nthey have already been provided for. Neat work, but might it not\\nbe just a little misleading?\\nThe ALCOA footnote says nothing about the future tax saving\\nfrom these losses. (Most other statements of this sort state specifi-\\ncally that only the “after-tax effect” has been charged off.) If the\\nALCOA figure represents future losses before the related tax credit,\\nthen not only will future earnings be freed from the weight of these\\ncharges (as they are actually incurred), but they will be increased by\\na tax credit of some 50% thereof. It is difficult to believe that the\\naccounts will be handled that way. But it is a fact that certain com-\\npanies which have had large losses in the past have been able to\\nreport future earnings without charging the normal taxes against\\nthem, in that way making a very fine profits appearance indeed—\\nbased paradoxically enough on their past disgraces. (Tax credits\\nresulting from past years’ losses are now being shown separately as\\n“special items,” but they will enter into future statistics as part of\\nthe final “net-income” figure. However, a reserve now set up for\\nfuture losses, if net of expected tax credit, should not create an addi-\\ntion of this sort to the net income of later years.)\\nThe other ingenious feature is the use by ALCOA and many\\nother companies of the 1970 year-end for making these special\\ncharge-offs. The stock market took what appeared to be a blood\\nbath in the first half of 1970. Everyone expected relatively poor\\nresults for the year for most companies. Wall Street was now antic-\\nipating better results in 1971, 1972, etc. What a nice arrangement,\\nthen, to charge as much as possible to the bad year, which had\\nalready been written off mentally and had virtually receded into\\nthe past, leaving the way clear for nicely fattened figures in the\\nnext few years!

To this should be added some bonus figure,\\nrepresenting the value per share of the important but temporary\\ntax exemption the company will enjoy. (Allowance must be made,\\nalso, for a possible large-scale dilution in this case. Actually, the\\nconvertible preferred issues and warrants would more than double\\nthe outstanding common shares if the privileges are exercised.)\\nAll this may be confusing and wearisome to our readers, but it\\nbelongs in our story. Corporate accounting is often tricky; security\\nanalysis can be complicated; stock valuations are really depend-\\nable only in exceptional cases.† For most investors it would be\\nprobably best to assure themselves that they are getting good value\\nfor the prices they pay, and let it go at that.\\n318 The Intelligent Investor\\n* Graham is referring to the provision of Federal tax law that allows corpora-\\ntions to “carry forward” their net operating losses. As the tax code now\\nstands, these losses can be carried forward for up to 20 years, reducing the\\ncompany’s tax liability for the entire period (and thus raising its earnings\\nafter tax). Therefore, investors should consider whether recent severe\\nlosses could actually improve the company’s net earnings in the future.\\n† Investors should keep these words at hand and remind themselves of\\nthem frequently: “Stock valuations are really dependable only in exceptional\\ncases. ” While the prices of most stocks are approximately right most of the\\ntime, the price of a stock and the value of its business are almost never iden-\\ntical. The market’s judgment on price is often unreliable. Unfortunately, the\\nmargin of the market’s pricing errors is often not wide enough to justify the\\nexpense of trading on them. The intelligent investor must carefully evaluate\\nthe costs of trading and taxes before attempting to take advantage of any\\nprice discrepancy—and should never count on being able to sell for the\\nexact price currently quoted in the market.'),\n",

Where the growth has\\nbeen large the recent earnings will be well above the seven- or ten-\\nyear average, and analysts may deem these long-term figures irrel-\\nevant. This need not be the case.

There should be sufficient variety in the financial and\\noperating data to make the examination of interest.\\nIn Table 13-1 we present a summary of what the four companies\\nwere selling for in the market at the end of 1970, and a few figures\\non their 1970 operations. We then detail certain key ratios, which\\nrelate on the one hand to performance and on the other to price.\\nComment is called for on how various aspects of the performance\\npattern agree with the relative price pattern. Finally, we shall pass\\nthe four companies in review, suggesting some comparisons and\\nrelationships and evaluating each in terms of the requirements of a\\nconservative common-stock investor.\\n330\\n* Of Graham’s four examples, only Emerson Electric still exists in the same\\nform. ELTRA Corp. is no longer an independent company; it merged with\\nBunker Ramo Corp. in the 1970s, putting it in the business of supplying\\nstock quotes to brokerage firms across an early network of computers.\\nWhat remains of ELTRA’s operations is now part of Honeywell Corp.

Profitability. (a) All the companies show satisfactory earnings\\non their book value, but the figures for Emerson and Emery are\\nmuch higher than for the other two.

(b) For manufacturing\\ncompanies, the profit figure per dollar of sales is usually an indica-\\ntion of comparative strength or weakness. We use here the “ratio of\\noperating income to sales,” as given in Standard & Poor’s Listed\\nStock Reports. Here again the results are satisfactory for all four\\ncompanies, with an especially impressive showing by Emerson.\\nThe changes between 1961 and 1969 vary considerably among the\\ncompanies.\\n2. Stability. This we measure by the maximum decline in per-\\nshare earnings in any one of the past ten years, as against the aver-\\nage of the three preceding years. No decline translates into 100%\\nstability, and this was registered by the two popular concerns.

Price History. The reader should be impressed by the percent-\\nage advance shown in the price of all four of these issues, as mea-\\nsured from the lowest to the highest points during the past 34\\nyears. (In all cases the low price has been adjusted for subsequent\\nstock splits.)

(But they may indicate also how overdone were the\\ndeclines in the bear markets before 1950 when the low prices were\\nregistered.) Both eltra and Emhart sustained price shrinkages of\\nmore than 50% in the 1969–70 price break.

For Zenith had a brilliant growth record for many\\nyears; it too sold in the market for $1.7 billion (in 1966); but its prof-\\nits fell from $43 million in 1968 to only half as much in 1970, and in\\nthat year’s big selloff its price declined to 22 1⁄2 against the previous\\ntop of 89. High valuations entail high risks.\\nEmery Air Freight must be the most promising of the four compa-\\nnies in terms of future growth, if the price/earnings ratio of nearly 40\\ntimes its highest reported earnings is to be even partially justified.\\nThe past growth, of course, has been most impressive. But these fig-\\nures may not be so significant for the future if we consider that they\\nstarted quite small, at only $570,000 of net earnings in 1958. It often\\nproves much more difficult to continue to grow at a high rate after\\nvolume and profits have already expanded to big totals. The most\\nsurprising aspect of Emery’s story is that its earnings and market\\nprice continued to grow apace in 1970, which was the worst year in\\nthe domestic air-passenger industry. This is a remarkable achieve-\\nment indeed, but it raises the question whether future profits may\\nnot be vulnerable to adverse developments, through increased com-\\npetition, pressure for new arrangements between forwarders and air-\\nlines, etc. An elaborate study might be needed before a sound\\njudgment could be passed on these points, but the conservative\\ninvestor cannot leave them out of his general reckoning.\\nEmhart and eltra.

The shares are worth holding (at 34).”\\nConclusions: Many financial analysts will find Emerson and\\nEmery more interesting and appealing stocks than the other two—\\nprimarily, perhaps, because of their better “market action,” and\\nsecondarily because of their faster recent growth in earnings.\\nUnder our principles of conservative investment the first is not a\\nvalid reason for selection—that is something for the speculators to\\nplay around with. The second has validity, but within limits. Can\\nthe past growth and the presumably good prospects of Emery Air\\nFreight justify a price more than 60 times its recent earnings? 1 Our\\nanswer would be: Maybe for someone who has made an in-depth\\nstudy of the possibilities of this company and come up with excep-\\ntionally firm and optimistic conclusions.

On those revenues\\nEmerson earned $1.3 billion in net income, or 6.9% more than in\\n1998. Over the previous five years, earnings per share had risen at a\\nrobust average rate of 8.3%. Emerson’s dividend had more than dou-\\nbled to $1.30 per share; book value had gone from $6.69 to $14.27\\nper share. According to Value Line, throughout the 1990s, Emerson’s\\nnet profit margin and return on capital—key measures of its efficiency\\nas a business—had stayed robustly high, around 9% and 18% respec-\\ntively. What’s more, Emerson had increased its earnings for 42 years\\nin a row and had raised its dividend for 43 straight years—one of the\\nlongest runs of steady growth in American business. At year-end,\\nEmerson’s stock was priced at 17 .7 times the company’s net income\\nper share. Like its power tools, Emerson was never flashy, but it was\\nreliable—and showed no sign of overheating.\\nCOULD EMC GROW PDQ?\\nEMC Corp. was one of the best-performing stocks of the 1990s, \\nrising—or should we say levitating?—more than 81,000%. If you had\\ninvested $10,000 in EMC’s stock at the beginning of 1990, you\\nwould have ended 1999 with just over $8.1 million. EMC’s shares\\nreturned 157 .1% in 1999 alone—more than Emerson’s stock had\\ngained in the eight years from 1992 through 1999 combined. EMC\\nhad never paid a dividend, instead retaining all its earnings “to provide\\nfunds for the continued growth of the company. ” 1 At their December\\nCommentary on Chapter 13 341\\n1 As we will see in Chapter 19, this rationale often means, in practice, “to pro-\\nvide funds for the continued growth of the company’s top managers’ wealth. ”'),\n",

When Insana asked if EMC’s stock was\\novervalued, Ruettgers answered: “I think when you look at the opportunity\\nwe have in front of us, it’s almost unlimited. . . . So while it’s hard to predict\\nwhether these things are overpriced, there’s such a major change taking\\nplace that if you could find the winners today—and I certainly think EMC is\\none of those people—you’ll be well rewarded in the future. ”\\n3 The “Y2K bug” or the “Year 2000 Problem” was the belief that millions of\\ncomputers worldwide would stop functioning at one second past midnight'),\n",

Adequate Size of the Enterprise\\nAll our minimum figures must be arbitrary and especially in the\\nmatter of size required. Our idea is to exclude small companies\\nwhich may be subject to more than average vicissitudes especially\\nin the industrial field.

Let us use round amounts: not less than $100\\nmillion of annual sales for an industrial company and, not less than\\n$50 million of total assets for a public utility.\\n2. A Sufficiently Strong Financial Condition\\nFor industrial companies current assets should be at least twice\\ncurrent liabilities—a so-called two-to-one current ratio. Also, long-\\nterm debt should not exceed the net current assets (or “working\\ncapital”). For public utilities the debt should not exceed twice the\\nstock equity (at book value).\\n3. Earnings Stability\\nSome earnings for the common stock in each of the past ten\\nyears.\\n4. Dividend Record\\nUninterrupted payments for at least the past 20 years.\\n5.

Moderate Price/Earnings Ratio\\nCurrent price should not be more than 15 times average earn-\\nings of the past three years.\\n7. Moderate Ratio of Price to Assets\\nCurrent price should not be more than 11⁄2 times the book value last\\nreported. However, a multiplier of earnings below 15 could justify a\\ncorrespondingly higher multiplier of assets. As a rule of thumb we\\nsuggest that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to\\nbook value should not exceed 22.5. (This figure corresponds to 15\\ntimes earnings and 11⁄2 times book value. It would admit an issue sell-\\ning at only 9 times earnings and 2.5 times asset value, etc.)\\nGeneral Comments: These requirements are set up especially\\nfor the needs and the temperament of defensive investors. They\\nwill eliminate the great majority of common stocks as candidates\\nfor the portfolio, and in two opposite ways. On the one hand they\\nwill exclude companies that are (1) too small, (2) in relatively weak\\nfinancial condition, (3) with a deficit stigma in their ten-year\\nrecord, and (4) not having a long history of continuous dividends.\\nOf these tests the most severe under recent financial conditions are\\nthose of financial strength. A considerable number of our large and\\nformerly strongly entrenched enterprises have weakened their cur-\\nrent ratio or overexpanded their debt, or both, in recent years.\\nOur last two criteria are exclusive in the opposite direction, by\\ndemanding more earnings and more assets per dollar of price than\\nthe popular issues will supply. This is by no means the standard\\nviewpoint of financial analysts; in fact most will insist that even\\nconservative investors should be prepared to pay generous prices\\nfor stocks of the choice companies. We have expounded our con-\\ntrary view above; it rests largely on the absence of an adequate fac-\\ntor of safety when too large a portion of the price must depend on\\never-increasing earnings in the future. The reader will have to\\ndecide this important question for himself—after weighing the\\narguments on both sides.\\nWe have nonetheless opted for the inclusion of a modest\\nrequirement of growth over the past decade.

There is no reason for the defensive\\ninvestor to include such companies—though if the price is low\\nenough they could qualify as bargain opportunities.\\nThe suggested maximum figure of 15 times earnings might well\\nresult in a typical portfolio with an average multiplier of, say, 12 to\\n13 times. Note that in February 1972 American Tel. & Tel. sold at 11\\ntimes its three-year (and current) earnings, and Standard Oil of\\nCalifornia at less than 10 times latest earnings. Our basic recom-\\nmendation is that the stock portfolio, when acquired, should have\\nan overall earnings/price ratio—the reverse of the P/E ratio—at\\nleast as high as the current high-grade bond rate. This would mean\\na P/E ratio no higher than 13.3 against an AA bond yield of 7.5%.*\\nApplication of Our Criteria to the DJIA at the End of 1970\\nAll of our suggested criteria were satisfied by the DJIA issues at\\nthe end of 1970, but two of them just barely. Here is a survey based\\non the closing price of 1970 and the relevant figures. (The basic\\ndata for each company are shown in Tables 14-1 and 14-2.)\\n1. Size is more than ample for each company.\\n2. Financial condition is adequate in the aggregate, but not for\\nevery company.2\\n3. Some dividend has been paid by every company since at least\\n1940. Five of the dividend records go back to the last century.\\n350 The Intelligent Investor\\n* In early 2003, the yield on 10-year, AA-rated corporate bonds was around\\n4.6%, suggesting—by Graham’s formula—that a stock portfolio should have\\nan earnings-to-price ratio at least that high. Taking the inverse of that num-\\nber (by dividing 4.6 into 100), we can derive a “suggested maximum” P/E\\nratio of 21.7 . At the beginning of this paragraph Graham recommends that\\nthe “average” stock be priced about 20% below the “maximum” ratio. That\\nsuggests that—in general—Graham would consider stocks selling at no more\\nthan 17 times their three-year average earnings to be potentially attractive\\ngiven today’s interest rates and market conditions. As of December 31,\\n2002, more than 200—or better than 40%—of the stocks in the S & P 500-\\nstock index had three-year average P/E ratios of 17 .0 or lower.

The dividend return was significantly higher.\\nThe position of the utilities as regulated monopolies is assuredly\\nmore of an advantage than a disadvantage for the conservative\\ninvestor. Under law they are entitled to charge rates sufficiently\\nremunerative to attract the capital they need for their continuous\\nexpansion, and this implies adequate offsets to inflated costs.\\nWhile the process of regulation has often been cumbersome and\\nperhaps dilatory, it has not prevented the utilities from earning a\\nfair return on their rising invested capital over many decades.\\n356 The Intelligent Investor\\nceled and decommissioned nuclear energy plants; nor did he foresee the\\nconsequences of bungled regulation in California.

The question\\nof financial soundness is, therefore, more relevant here than in the\\ncase of the typical manufacturing or commercial enterprise. This,\\nin turn, has given rise to various forms of regulation and supervi-\\nsion, with the design and general result of assuring against\\nunsound financial practices.\\nBroadly speaking, the shares of financial concerns have pro-\\nduced investment results similar to those of other types of common\\nshares.

The bankruptcy of the Penn Central Trans-\\nportation Co., our most important railroad, in 1970 shocked the\\nfinancial world. Only a year and two years previously the stock\\nsold at close to the highest price level in its long history, and it had\\npaid continuous dividends for more than 120 years! (On p. 423\\nbelow we present a brief analysis of this railroad to illustrate how a\\ncompetent student could have detected the developing weaknesses\\nin the company’s picture and counseled against ownership of its\\nsecurities.) The market level of railroad shares as a whole was seri-\\nously affected by this financial disaster.\\nIt is usually unsound to make blanket recommendations of\\nwhole classes of securities, and there are equal objections to broad\\ncondemnations. The record of railroad share prices in Table 14-6\\nshows that the group as a whole has often offered chances for a\\nlarge profit. (But in our view the great advances were in them-\\nselves largely unwarranted.) Let us confine our suggestion to this:\\nThere is no compelling reason for the investor to own railroad\\nshares; before he buys any he should make sure that he is getting\\nso much value for his money that it would be unreasonable to look\\nfor something else instead.*\\n362 The Intelligent Investor\\n* Only a few major rail stocks now remain, including Burlington Northern,\\nCSX, Norfolk Southern, and Union Pacific. The advice in this section is at\\nleast as relevant to airline stocks today—with their massive current losses\\nand a half-century of almost incessantly poor results—as it was to railroads\\nin Graham’s day.'),\n",

The underlying\\nreason is that the current price of each prominent stock pretty well\\nreflects the salient factors in its financial record plus the general\\nopinion as to its future prospects.

An old joke has two finance professors walking along the sidewalk;\\nwhen one spots a $20 bill and bends over to pick it up, the other grabs his\\narm and says, “Don’t bother. If it was really a $20 bill, someone would have\\ntaken it already. ” While the market is not perfectly efficient, it is pretty close\\nmost of the time—so the intelligent investor will stoop to pick up the stock\\nmarket’s $20 bills only after researching them thoroughly and minimizing the\\ncosts of trading and taxes.'),\n",

Nevertheless, the future itself can be\\napproached in two different ways, which may be called the way of\\nprediction(or projection) and the way of protection.*\\nThose who emphasize prediction will endeavor to anticipate\\nfairly accurately just what the company will accomplish in future\\nyears—in particular whether earnings will show pronounced and\\npersistent growth.

Inflation and inter-\\nest rates are undependable; economic recessions come and go at random;\\ngeopolitical upheavals like war, commodity shortages, and terrorism arrive\\nwithout warning; and the fate of individual companies and their industries\\noften turns out to be the opposite of what most investors expect. Therefore,\\ninvesting on the basis of projection is a fool’s errand; even the forecasts of\\nthe so-called experts are less reliable than the flip of a coin. For most peo-\\nple, investing on the basis of protection—from overpaying for a stock and\\nfrom overconfidence in the quality of their own judgment—is the best solu-\\ntion.

Over the long run, money manager David Dreman has\\nshown, 59% of Wall Street’s “consensus” earnings forecasts miss the\\nmark by a mortifyingly wide margin—either underestimating or overesti-\\nmating the actual reported earnings by at least 15%.2 Investing your\\nmoney on the basis of what these myopic soothsayers predict for the\\ncoming year is as risky as volunteering to hold up the bulls-eye at an\\narchery tournament for the legally blind. Instead, calculate a stock’s\\nprice/earnings ratio yourself, using Graham’s formula of current price\\ndivided by average earnings over the past three years.3\\nAs of early 2003, how many stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500\\nindex were valued at no more than 15 times their average earnings of\\n2000 through 2002? According to Morgan Stanley, a generous total\\nof 185 companies passed Graham’s test.\\nModerate price-to-book ratio. Graham recommends a “ratio of\\nprice to assets” (or price-to-book-value ratio) of no more than 1.5. In\\nrecent years, an increasing proportion of the value of companies has\\ncome from intangible assets like franchises, brand names, and patents\\nand trademarks. Since these factors (along with goodwill from acqui-\\nsitions) are excluded from the standard definition of book value, most\\ncompanies today are priced at higher price-to-book multiples than in\\nGraham’s day. According to Morgan Stanley, 123 of the companies in\\nthe S & P 500 (or one in four) are priced below 1.5 times book value.\\n374 Commentary on Chapter 14\\n2 David Dreman, “Bubbles and the Role of Analysts’ Forecasts, ” The Journal\\nof Psychology and Financial Markets, vol. 3, no. 1 (2002), pp. 4–14.\\n3 You can calculate this ratio by hand from a company’s annual reports or\\nobtain the data at websites like www.morningstar.com or http://finance.\\nyahoo.com.'),\n",

But that improvement did not last.

But to the objec-\\ntive observer the failure of the funds to better the performance \\nof a broad average is a pretty conclusive indication that such an\\nachievement, instead of being easy, is in fact extremely difficult.\\nWhy should this be so? We can think of two different explana-\\ntions, each of which may be partially applicable. The first is the\\npossibility that the stock market does in fact reflect in the current\\nprices not only all the important facts about the companies’ past\\nand current performance, but also whatever expectations can be\\nreasonably formed as to their future. If this is so, then the diverse\\nmarket movements which subsequently take place—and these are\\noften extreme—must be the result of new developments and prob-\\nabilities that could not be reliably foreseen. This would make the\\nprice movements essentially fortuitous and random. To the extent\\nthat the foregoing is true, the work of the security analyst—how-\\never intelligent and thorough—must be largely ineffective, because\\nin essence he is trying to predict the unpredictable.\\nThe very multiplication of the number of security analysts may\\nhave played an important part in bringing about this result. With\\nhundreds, even thousands, of experts studying the value factors\\nbehind an important common stock, it would be natural to expect\\nthat its current price would reflect pretty well the consensus of\\ninformed opinion on its value. Those who would prefer it to other\\nissues would do so for reasons of personal partiality or optimism\\nthat could just as well be wrong as right.\\nWe have often thought of the analogy between the work of the\\nhost of security analysts on Wall Street and the performance of\\nmaster bridge players at a duplicate-bridge tournament. The for-\\nmer try to pick the stocks “most likely to succeed”; the latter to get\\ntop score for each hand played. Only a limited few can accomplish\\neither aim. To the extent that all the bridge players have about the\\nsame level of expertness, the winners are likely to be determined\\nby “breaks” of various sorts rather than superior skill. On Wall\\nStreet the leveling process is helped along by the freemasonry that\\nexists in the profession, under which ideas and discoveries are\\nquite freely shared at the numerous get-togethers of various sorts.\\n378 The Intelligent Investor'),\n",

Perhaps many\\nof the security analysts are handicapped by a flaw in their basic\\napproach to the problem of stock selection. They seek the indus-\\ntries with the best prospects of growth, and the companies in these\\nindustries with the best management and other advantages. The\\nimplication is that they will buy into such industries and such com-\\npanies at any price, however high, and they will avoid less promis-\\ning industries and companies no matter how low the price of their\\nshares. This would be the only correct procedure if the earnings of\\nthe good companies were sure to grow at a rapid rate indefinitely\\nin the future, for then in theory their value would be infinite.

The market’s valuation of\\na given stock is the result of a vast, continuous, real-time operation of col-\\nlective intelligence. Most of the time, for most stocks, that collective intelli-\\ngence gets the valuation approximately right. Only rarely does Graham’s\\n“Mr. Market” (see Chapter 8) send prices wildly out of whack.\\n† Graham launched Graham-Newman Corp. in January 1936, and dissolved\\nit when he retired from active money management in 1956; it was the suc-\\ncessor to a partnership called the Benjamin Graham Joint Account, which\\nhe ran from January 1926, through December 1935.'),\n",

In writing this book we have\\nmade a series of “experiments,” each based on a single, fairly obvi-\\nous criterion. The data used would be readily found in the Stan-\\ndard & Poor’s Stock Guide. In all cases a 30-stock portfolio was\\nassumed to have been acquired at the 1968 closing prices and then\\nrevalued at June 30, 1971. The separate criteria applied were the\\nfollowing, as applied to otherwise random choices: (1) A low multi-\\nplier of recent earnings (not confined to DJIA issues). (2) A high\\ndividend return. (3) A very long dividend record. (4) A very large\\nenterprise, as measured by number of outstanding shares. (5) A\\nstrong financial position. (6) A low price in dollars per share. (7) A\\nlow price in relation to the previous high price. (8) A high quality-\\nranking by Standard & Poor’s.\\nIt will be noted that the Stock Guide has at least one column relat-\\ning to each of the above criteria. This indicates the publisher’s\\nbelief that each is of importance in analyzing and choosing com-\\nmon stocks.

But our 90 randomly chosen issues\\ndeclined an average of 22%, not counting 19 issues that were\\ndropped from the Guide and probably showed larger losses. These\\ncomparative results undoubtedly reflect the tendency of smaller\\nissues of inferior quality to be relatively overvalued in bull mar-\\nkets, and not only to suffer more serious declines than the stronger\\nissues in the ensuing price collapse, but also to delay their full\\nrecovery—in many cases indefinitely.

It is clear that, at the least, a considerable momentum is\\nattached to those companies that combine the virtues of great size,\\nan excellent past record of earnings, the public’s expectation of\\ncontinued earnings growth in the future, and strong market action\\nover many past years. Even if the price may appear excessive by\\nour quantitative standards the underlying market momentum may\\nwell carry such issues along more or less indefinitely.

Acquisition of Kayser-Roth by Borden’s. In January\\n1971 Borden Inc. announced a plan to acquire control of Kayser-\\nRoth (“diversified apparel”) by giving 11⁄3 shares of its own stock in\\nexchange for one share of Kayser-Roth. On the following day, in\\nactive trading. Borden closed at 26 and Kayser-Roth at 28. If an\\n“operator” had bought 300 shares of Kayser-Roth and sold 400 Bor-\\nden at these prices and if the deal were later consummated on the\\nannounced terms, he would have had a profit of some 24% on the\\ncost of his shares, less commissions and some other items. Assum-\\ning the deal had gone through in six months, his final profit might\\nhave been at about a 40% per annum rate.\\nSituation 2. In November 1970 National Biscuit Co. offered to\\nbuy control of Aurora Plastics Co. at $11 in cash. The stock was sell-\\ning at about 81⁄2; it closed the month at 9 and continued to sell there at\\nyear-end. Here the gross profit indicated was originally about 25%,\\nsubject to the risks of nonconsummation and to the time element.\\nStock Selection for the Enterprising Investor 393'),\n",

Universal-Marion Co., which had ceased its business\\noperations, asked its shareholders to ratify dissolution of the concern.\\nThe treasurer indicated that the common stock had a book value of\\nabout $281⁄2 per share, a substantial part of which was in liquid form.\\nThe stock closed 1970 at 211⁄2, indicating a possible gross profit here, if\\nbook value was realized in liquidation, of more than 30%.\\nIf operations of this kind, conducted on a diversified basis for\\nspreading the risk, could be counted to yield annual profits of, say,\\n20% or better, they would undoubtedly be more than merely\\nworthwhile. Since this is not a book on “special situations,” we are\\nnot going into the details of the business—for it really is a business.\\nLet us point out two contradictory developments there in recent\\nyears. On the one hand the number of deals to choose from has\\nincreased enormously, as compared with, say, ten years ago. This is\\na consequence of what might be called a mania of corporations to\\ndiversify their activities through various types of acquisitions, etc.\\nIn 1970 the number of “merger announcements” aggregated some\\n5,000, down from over 6,000 in 1969. The total money values\\ninvolved in these deals amounted to many, many billions. Perhaps\\nonly a small fraction of the 5,000 announcements could have pre-\\nsented a clear-cut opportunity for purchase of shares by a special-\\nsituations man, but this fraction was still large enough to keep him\\nbusy studying, picking, and choosing.\\nThe other side of the picture is that an increasing proportion of\\nthe mergers announced failed to be consummated. In such cases, of\\ncourse, the aimed-for profit is not realized, and is likely to be\\nreplaced by a more or less serious loss. Reasons for nonsuccess are\\nnumerous, including antitrust intervention, shareholder opposi-\\ntion, change in “market conditions,” unfavorable indications from\\nfurther study, inability to agree on details, and others. The trick\\nhere, of course, is to have the judgment, buttressed by experience,\\nto pick the deals most likely to succeed and also those which are\\nlikely to occasion the smallest loss if they fail.*\\n394 The Intelligent Investor\\n* As discussed in the commentary on Chapter 7 , merger arbitrage is wholly\\ninappropriate for most individual investors.'),\n",

The issuer is able to raise capital at a moderate\\ninterest or preferred dividend cost, and if the expected prosperity\\nmaterializes the issuer will get rid of the senior obligation by hav-\\ning it exchanged into common stock. Thus both sides to the bargain\\nwill fare unusually well.\\nObviously the foregoing paragraph must overstate the case\\nsomewhere, for you cannot by a mere ingenious device make a bar-\\ngain much better for both sides. In exchange for the conversion\\nprivilege the investor usually gives up something important in\\nquality or yield, or both. 1 Conversely, if the company gets its\\nmoney at lower cost because of the conversion feature, it is surren-\\ndering in return part of the common shareholders’ claim to future\\nenhancement. On this subject there are a number of tricky argu-\\nments to be advanced both pro and con. The safest conclusion that\\ncan be reached is that convertible issues are like any other form of\\nsecurity, in that their form itself guarantees neither attractiveness\\nnor unattractiveness. That question will depend on all the facts\\nsurrounding the individual issue.*\\nWe do know, however, that the group of convertible issues\\nfloated during the latter part of a bull market are bound to yield\\nunsatisfactory results as a whole. (It is at such optimistic periods,\\nunfortunately, that most of the convertible financing has been done\\nin the past.) The poor consequences must be inevitable, from the\\ntiming itself, since a wide decline in the stock market must invari-\\nably make the conversion privilege much less attractive—and\\noften, also, call into question the underlying safety of the issue\\nitself.† As a group illustration we shall retain the example used in\\n404 The Intelligent Investor\\n* Graham is pointing out that, despite the promotional rhetoric that investors\\nusually hear, convertible bonds do not automatically offer “the best of both\\nworlds. ” Higher yield and lower risk do not always go hand in hand. What\\nWall Street gives with one hand, it usually takes away with the other. An\\ninvestment may offer the best of one world, or the worst of another; but the\\nbest of both worlds seldom becomes available in a single package.\\n† According to Goldman Sachs and Ibbotson Associates, from 1998\\nthrough 2002, convertibles generated an average annual return of 4.8%.\\nThat was considerably better than the 0.6% annual loss on U.S. stocks, but\\nsubstantially worse than the returns of medium-term corporate bonds (a'),\n",

We were members of a\\n“select group,” mainly of investment funds, who participated in a\\nprivate offering of convertible 41⁄2% debentures of Eversharp Co. at\\npar, convertible into common stock at $40 per share. The stock\\nadvanced rapidly to 651⁄2, and then (after a three-for-two split) to the\\nequivalent of 88. The latter price made the convertible debentures\\nworth no less than 220. During this period the two issues were\\ncalled at a small premium; hence they were practically all converted\\ninto common stock, which was retained by a number of the original\\ninvestment-fund buyers of the debentures. The price promptly\\nbegan a severe decline, and in March 1948 the stock sold as low as\\n73⁄8. This represented a value of only 27 for the debenture issues, or a\\nloss of 75% of the original price instead of a profit of over 100%.\\nThe real point of this story is that some of the original purchasers\\nconverted their bonds into the stock and held the stock through its\\ngreat decline. In so doing they ran counter to an old maxim of Wall\\nStreet, which runs: “Never convert a convertible bond.” Why this\\nadvice? Because once you convert you have lost your strategic com-\\nbination of prior claimant to interest plus a chance for an attractive\\nprofit.

The convertible\\nbonds had the important advantage to the company of bringing in\\na much wider class of buyers than would have been available for a\\nstock offering, since the bonds were popular with many financial\\ninstitutions which possess huge resources but some of which were\\nnot permitted to buy stocks.

Since the company maintained its $9 dividend\\nrate for 40 years (from 1919 to the stock split in 1959) the result was\\nthe eventual conversion of virtually all the convertible issues into\\ncommon stock.

We consider the recent\\ndevelopment of stock-option warrants as a near fraud, an existing\\nmenace, and a potential disaster. They have created huge aggregate\\ndollar “values” out of thin air. They have no excuse for existence\\nexcept to the extent that they mislead speculators and investors.\\nThey should be prohibited by law, or at least strictly limited to a\\nminor part of the total capitalization of a company.*\\nFor an analogy in general history and in literature we refer the\\nreader to the section of Faust (part 2), in which Goethe describes\\nthe invention of paper money. As an ominous precedent on Wall\\nStreet history, we may mention the warrants of American & For-\\neign Power Co., which in 1929 had a quoted market value of over a\\nbillion dollars, although they appeared only in a footnote to the\\ncompany’s balance sheet. By 1932 this billion dollars had shrunk to\\n$8 million, and in 1952 the warrants were wiped out in the\\ncompany’s recapitalization—even though it had remained solvent.\\nOriginally, stock-option warrants were attached now and then\\nto bond issues, and were usually equivalent to a partial conversion\\nprivilege. They were unimportant in amount, and hence did no\\nharm. Their use expanded in the late 1920s, along with many other\\nfinancial abuses, but they dropped from sight for long years there-\\nafter. They were bound to turn up again, like the bad pennies they\\nare, and since 1967 they have become familiar “instruments of\\nConvertible Issues and Warrants 413\\n* Warrants were an extremely widespread technique of corporate finance in\\nthe nineteenth century and were fairly common even in Graham’s day.

Example: In\\n1971 CleveTrust Realty Investors sold 2,500,000 of these combina-\\ntions of common stock (or “shares of beneficial interest”) and war-\\nrants, for $20 per unit.\\nLet us consider for a moment what is really involved in this\\nfinancial setup. Ordinarily, a common-stock issue has the first right\\nto buy additional common shares when the company’s directors\\nfind it desirable to raise capital in this manner. This so-called “pre-\\nemptive right” is one of the elements of value entering into the\\nownership of common stock—along with the right to receive divi-\\ndends, to participate in the company’s growth, and to vote for\\ndirectors. When separate warrants are issued for the right to sub-\\nscribe additional capital, that action takes away part of the value\\ninherent in an ordinary common share and transfers it to a separate\\ncertificate. An analogous thing could be done by issuing separate\\ncertificates for the right to receive dividends (for a limited or\\nunlimited period), or the right to share in the proceeds of sale or\\nliquidation of the enterprise, or the right to vote the shares. Why\\nthen are these subscription warrants created as part of the original\\ncapital structure? Simply because people are inexpert in financial\\nmatters. They don’t realize that the common stock is worth less\\nwith warrants outstanding than otherwise. Hence the package of\\nstock and warrants usually commands a better price in the market\\nthan would the stock alone. Note that in the usual company reports\\nthe per-share earnings are (or have been) computed without\\nproper allowance for the effect of outstanding warrants. The result\\nis, of course, to overstate the true relationship between the earnings\\nand the market value of the company’s capitalization.*\\n414 The Intelligent Investor\\n* Today, the last remnant of activity in warrants is in the cesspool of the\\nNASDAQ “bulletin board, ” or over-the-counter market for tiny companies,\\nwhere common stock is often bundled with warrants into a “unit” (the con-\\ntemporary equivalent of what Graham calls a “package”). If a stockbroker\\never offers to sell you “units” in any company, you can be 95% certain that\\nwarrants are involved, and at least 90% certain that the broker is either a\\nthief or an idiot.

The buyer of the option, meanwhile, has the contractual\\nright to buy your Ixnay shares at a mutually agreed-upon price—\\nsay, $100.

Its bankruptcy in 1970 shocked the financial world. It has\\ndefaulted on most of its bond issues, and has been in danger of\\nabandoning its operations entirely. Its security issues fell drasti-\\ncally in price, the common stock collapsing from a high level of 861⁄2\\nas recently as 1968 to a low of 5 1⁄2 in 1970. (There seems little doubt\\nthat these shares will be wiped out in reorganization.)*\\nOur basic point is that the application of the simplest rules of\\nsecurity analysis and the simplest standards of sound investment\\nwould have revealed the fundamental weakness of the Penn Cen-\\ntral system long before its bankruptcy—certainly in 1968, when the\\nshares were selling at their post-1929 record, and when most of its\\nbond issues could have been exchanged at even prices for well-\\nsecured public-utility obligations with the same coupon rates. The\\nfollowing comments are in order:\\n1. In the S & P Bond Guide the interest charges of the system are\\nshown to have been earned 1.91 times in 1967 and 1.98 times in\\n1968. The minimum coverage prescribed for railroad bonds in our\\ntextbookSecurity Analysis is 5 times before income taxes and 2.9\\ntimes after income taxes at regular rates. As far as we know the\\nvalidity of these standards has never been questioned by any\\ninvestment authority. On the basis of our requirements for earnings\\nafter taxes, the Penn Central fell short of the requirements for safety.\\nBut our after-tax requirement is based on a before-tax ratio of five\\ntimes, with regular income tax deducted after the bond interest. In\\nthe case of Penn Central, it had been paying no income taxes to speak\\nof for the past 11 years! Hence the coverage of its interest charges\\nbefore taxes was less than two times—a totally inadequate figure\\nagainst our conservative requirement of 5 times.\\nFour Extremely Instructive Case Histories 423\\n* How “shocked” was the financial world by the Penn Central’s bankruptcy,\\nwhich was filed over the weekend of June 20–21, 1970? The closing trade\\nin Penn Central’s stock on Friday, June 19, was $11.25 per share—hardly a\\ngoing-out-of-business price. In more recent times, stocks like Enron and\\nWorldCom have also sold at relatively high prices shortly before filing for\\nbankruptcy protection.'),\n",

The fact that the company paid no income taxes over so long a\\nperiod should have raised serious questions about the validity of its\\nreported earnings.\\n3. The bonds of the Penn Central system could have been\\nexchanged in 1968 and 1969, at no sacrifice of price or income, for\\nfar better secured issues. For example, in 1969, Pennsylvania RR\\n41⁄2s, due 1994 (part of Penn Central) had a range of 61 to 741⁄2, while\\nPennsylvania Electric Co. 43⁄8s, due 1994, had a range of 64 1⁄4 to 721⁄4.\\nThe public utility had earned its interest 4.20 times before taxes in\\n1968 against only 1.98 times for the Penn Central system; during\\n1969 the latter’s comparative showing grew steadily worse. An\\nexchange of this sort was clearly called for, and it would have been\\na lifesaver for a Penn Central bondholder. (At the end of 1970 the\\nrailroad 41⁄4s were in default, and selling at only 18 1⁄2, while the\\nutility’s 43⁄8s closed at 661⁄2.)\\n4. Penn Central reported earnings of $3.80 per share in 1968; its\\nhigh price of 86 1⁄2 in that year was 24 times such earnings. But any\\nanalyst worth his salt would have wondered how “real” were\\nearnings of this sort reported without the necessity of paying any\\nincome taxes thereon.\\n5. For 1966 the newly merged company* had reported “earn-\\nings” of $6.80 a share—in reflection of which the common stock\\nlater rose to its peak of 861⁄2. This was a valuation of over $2 billion\\nfor the equity. How many of these buyers knew at the time that the\\nso lovely earnings were before a special charge of $275 million or\\n$12 per share to be taken in 1971 for “costs and losses” incurred on\\nthe merger.

Right after the close of 1969 the company bought in no less\\nthan 650,000 warrants at a price of $9.38 each. This was extraordi-\\nnary when we consider that ( a) NVF itself had only $700,000 in\\ncash at the year-end, and had $4,400,000 of debt due in 1970 (evi-\\ndently the $6 million paid for the warrants had to be borrowed); (b)\\nit was buying in this warrant “paper money” at a time when its 5%\\nbonds were selling at less than 40 cents on the dollar—ordinarily a\\nwarning that financial difficulties lay ahead.\\n2. As a partial offset to this, the company had retired $5,100,000\\nof its bonds along with 253,000 warrants in exchange for a like\\namount of common stock. This was possible because, by the\\nvagaries of the securities markets, people were selling the 5%\\nbonds at less than 40 while the common sold at an average price of\\n131⁄2, paying no dividend.\\n3. The company had plans in operation not only for selling stock\\nto its employees, but also for selling them a larger number of war-\\nrants to buy the stock. Like the stock purchases the warrants were\\nto be paid for 5% down and the rest over many years in the future.\\nThis is the only such employee-purchase plan for warrants that we\\nknow of.

In that year he sold $5,800,000 of mobile homes\\nand earned $61,000 before corporate tax. By 1968 he had joined the\\n“franchising” movement and was selling others the right to sell\\nmobile homes under his business name. He also conceived the\\nbright idea of going into the business of preparing income-tax\\nreturns, using his mobile homes as offices. He formed a subsidiary\\ncompany called Mr. Tax of America, and of course started to sell\\nfranchises to others to use the idea and the name. He multiplied\\nthe number of corporate shares to 2,710,000 and was ready for a\\nstock offering. He found that one of our largest stock-exchange\\nhouses, along with others, was willing to handle the deal. In March\\n1969 they offered the public 500,000 shares of AAA Enterprises at\\n$13 per share. Of these, 300,000 were sold for Mr. Williams’s per-\\nsonal account and 200,000 were sold for the company account,\\nadding $2,400,000 to its resources. The price of the stock promptly\\ndoubled to 28, or a value of $84 million for the equity, against a\\nbook value of, say, $4,200,000 and maximum reported earnings of\\n$690,000. The stock was thus selling at a tidy 115 times its current\\n(and largest) earnings per share. No doubt Mr. Williams had\\nselected the name AAA Enterprise so that it might be among the\\nfirst in the phone books and the yellow pages. A collateral result\\nwas that his company was destined to appear as the first name in\\nStandard & Poor’s Stock Guide.

What happened in the next months was literally incredible.\\nThe company lost $4,365,000, or $1.49 per share. This consumed all its\\ncapital before the financing, plus the entire $2,400,000 received on the\\nsale of stock plus two-thirds of the amount reported as earned in the\\nfirst nine months of 1969.

Nonetheless the shares\\nclosed the year 1969 at 81⁄8 bid, or a “valuation” of more than $25 mil-\\nlion for the company.\\nFurther Comment: 1. It is too much to believe that the company\\nhad actually earned $686,000 from January to September 1969 and\\nthen lost $4,365,000 in the next three months. There was something\\nsadly, badly, and accusingly wrong about the September 30 report.\\n2. The year’s closing price of 8 1⁄8 bid was even more of a demon-\\nstration of the complete heedlessness of stock-market prices than\\nwere the original offering price of 13 or the subsequent “hot-issue”\\nadvance to a high bid of 28. These latter quotations at least were\\nbased on enthusiasm and hope—out of all proportion to reality and\\ncommon sense, but at least comprehensible. The year-end valuation\\nof $25 million was given to a company that had lost all but a minus-\\ncule remnant of its capital, for which a completely insolvent condi-\\ntion was imminent, and for which the words “enthusiasm” or “hope”\\nwould be only bitter sarcasms.

It now had a good-sized capital deficit. It was kept out\\nof bankruptcy by loans made by Mr. Williams, up to a total of\\n$2,500,000. No further statements seem to have been issued, until\\nin January 1971 AAA Enterprises finally filed a petition in bank-\\nruptcy. The quotation for the stock at month-end was still 50 cents\\na share bid, or $1,500,000 for the entire issue, which evidently had\\nno more than wallpaper value.

One is moved to ask how could Presto\\npossibly be valued at only 6.9 times its current earnings when the\\nmultiplier for General was nearly 10 times as great. All the ratios of\\nPresto are quite satisfactory—the growth figure suspiciously so, in\\nfact. By that we mean that the company was undoubtedly benefit-\\ning considerably from its war work, and the shareholders should\\nbe prepared for some falling off in profits under peacetime condi-\\ntions. But, on balance, Presto met all the requirements of a sound\\nand reasonably priced investment, while General had all the ear-\\nmarks of a typical “conglomerate” of the late 1960s vintage, full of\\ncorporate gadgets and grandiose gestures, but lacking in substan-\\ntial values behind the market quotations.\\nSEQUEL: General continued its diversification policy in 1969, with\\nsome increase in its debt. But it took a whopping write-off of mil-\\nlions, chiefly in the value of its investment in the Minnie Pearl\\nChicken deal. The final figures showed a loss of $72 million before\\ntax credit and $46.4 million after tax credit. The price of the shares\\nfell to 161⁄2 in 1969 and as low as 9 in 1970 (only 15% of its 1968 high\\nof 60). Earnings for 1970 were reported as $2.33 per share diluted,\\nand the price recovered to 281⁄2 in 1971. National Presto increased its\\nper-share earnings somewhat in both 1969 and 1970, marking 10\\nyears of uninterrupted growth of profits. Nonetheless its price\\ndeclined to 211⁄2 in the 1970 debacle. This was an interesting figure,\\nsince it was less than four times the last reported earnings, and less\\nthan the net current assets available for the stock at the time. Late in\\n1971 we find the price of National Presto 60% higher, at 34, but the\\nratios are still startling. The enlarged working capital is still about\\nequal to the current price, which in turn is only 51⁄2 times the last\\nreported earnings. If the investor could now find ten such issues, for\\ndiversification, he could be confident of satisfactory results.*\\n466 The Intelligent Investor\\n* National Presto remains a publicly-traded company. National General was\\nacquired in 1974 by another controversial conglomerate, American Financial\\nGroup, which at various times has had interests in cable television, banking,\\nreal estate, mutual funds, insurance, and bananas.

Those individual shareholders who\\nhave enough gumption to make their presence felt at annual meet-\\nings—generally a completely futile performance—will not need\\nour counsel on what points to raise with the managements. For\\nothers the advice would probably be wasted. Nevertheless, let us\\nclose this section with the plea that shareholders consider with an\\nopen mind and with careful attention any proxy material sent them\\nby fellow-shareholders who want to remedy an obviously unsatis-\\nfactory management situation in the company.\\nShareholders and Dividend Policy\\nIn the past the dividend policy was a fairly frequent subject of\\nargument between public, or “minority,” shareholders and man-\\nagements. In general these shareholders wanted more liberal divi-\\ndends, while the managements preferred to keep the earnings in\\nthe business “to strengthen the company.” They asked the share-\\nholders to sacrifice their present interests for the good of the enter-\\nprise and for their own future long-term benefit. But in recent years\\nthe attitude of investors toward dividends has been undergoing a\\ngradual but significant change. The basic argument now for paying\\nsmall rather than liberal dividends is not that the company\\n“needs” the money, but rather that it can use it to the shareholders’\\ndirect and immediate advantage by retaining the funds for prof-\\nitable expansion. Years ago it was typically the weak company that\\nwas more or less forced to hold on to its profits, instead of paying\\nout the usual 60% to 75% of them in dividends. The effect was\\nalmost always adverse to the market price of the shares. Nowadays\\nit is quite likely to be a strong and growing enterprise that deliber-\\nately keeps down its dividend payments, with the approval of\\ninvestors and speculators alike.*\\nThere was always a strong theoretical case for reinvesting prof-\\nShareholders and Managements 489\\n* The irony that Graham describes here grew even stronger in the 1990s,\\nwhen it almost seemed that the stronger the company was, the less likely it\\nwas to pay a dividend—or for its shareholders to want one. The “payout\\nratio” (or the percentage of their net income that companies paid out as div-\\nidends) dropped from “60% to 75%” in Graham’s day to 35% to 40% by\\nthe end of the 1990s.'),\n",

But there were several\\nstrong counter-arguments, such as: The profits “belong” to the\\nshareholders, and they are entitled to have them paid out within\\nthe limits of prudent management; many of the shareholders need\\ntheir dividend income to live on; the earnings they receive in divi-\\ndends are “real money,” while those retained in the company may\\nor may not show up later as tangible values for the shareholders.\\nThese counter-arguments were so compelling, in fact, that the stock\\nmarket showed a persistent bias in favor of the liberal dividend\\npayers as against the companies that paid no dividends or rela-\\ntively small ones.1\\nIn the last 20 years the “profitable reinvestment” theory has\\nbeen gaining ground. The better the past record of growth, the\\nreadier investors and speculators have become to accept a low-\\npay-out policy. So much is this true that in many cases of growth\\nfavorites the dividend rate—or even the absence of any dividend—\\nhas seemed to have virtually no effect on the market price.*\\nA striking example of this development is found in the history\\nof Texas Instruments, Incorporated. The price of its common stock\\nrose from 5 in 1953 to 256 in 1960, while earnings were advancing\\nfrom 43 cents to $3.91 per share and while no dividend of any kind\\nwas paid. (In 1962 cash dividends were initiated, but by that year\\nthe earnings had fallen to $2.14 and the price had shown a spectac-\\nular drop to a low of 49.)\\nAnother extreme illustration is provided by Superior Oil. In\\n1948 the company reported earnings of $35.26 per share, paid $3 in\\ndividends, and sold as high as 235. In 1953 the dividend was\\nreduced to $1, but the high price was 660. In 1957 it paid no dividend\\n490 The Intelligent Investor\\n* In the late 1990s, technology companies were particularly strong advo-\\ncates of the view that all of their earnings should be “plowed back into the\\nbusiness, ” where they could earn higher returns than any outside share-\\nholder possibly could by reinvesting the same cash if it were paid out to him\\nor her in dividends. Incredibly, investors never questioned the truth of this\\npatronizing Daddy-Knows-Best principle—or even realized that a company’s\\ncash belongs to the shareholders, not its managers.

This unusual issue later declined to 795 in\\n1962, when it earned $49.50 and paid $7.50.*\\nInvestment sentiment is far from crystallized in this matter of\\ndividend policy of growth companies. The conflicting views are\\nwell illustrated by the cases of two of our very largest corpora-\\ntions—American Telephone & Telegraph and International Busi-\\nness Machines. American Tel. & Tel. came to be regarded as an\\nissue with good growth possibilities, as shown by the fact that in\\n1961 it sold at 25 times that year’s earnings. Nevertheless, the\\ncompany’s cash dividend policy has remained an investment and\\nspeculative consideration of first importance, its quotation making\\nan active response to even rumors of an impending increase in the\\ndividend rate. On the other hand, comparatively little attention\\nappears to have been paid to the cash dividend on IBM, which in\\n1960 yielded only 0.5% at the high price of the year and 1.5% at the\\nclose of 1970. (But in both cases stock splits have operated as a\\npotent stock-market influence.)\\nThe market’s appraisal of cash-dividend policy appears to be\\ndeveloping in the following direction: Where prime emphasis is\\nnot placed on growth the stock is rated as an “income issue,” and\\nthe dividend rate retains its long-held importance as the prime\\ndeterminant of market price. At the other extreme, stocks clearly\\nrecognized to be in the rapid-growth category are valued primarily\\nin terms of the expected growth rate over, say, the next decade, and\\nthe cash-dividend rate is more or less left out of the reckoning.\\nWhile the above statement may properly describe present ten-\\ndencies, it is by no means a clear-cut guide to the situation in all\\ncommon stocks, and perhaps not in the majority of them. For one\\nthing, many companies occupy an intermediate position between\\ngrowth and nongrowth enterprises.

This is the thread that runs through all the preceding dis-\\ncussion of investment policy—often explicitly, sometimes in a less\\ndirect fashion. Let us try now, briefly, to trace that idea in a con-\\nnected argument.\\nAll experienced investors recognize that the margin-of-safety\\nconcept is essential to the choice of sound bonds and preferred\\nstocks. For example, a railroad should have earned its total fixed\\ncharges better than five times (before income tax), taking a period\\nof years, for its bonds to qualify as investment-grade issues. This\\npastability to earn in excess of interest requirements constitutes the\\nmargin of safety that is counted on to protect the investor against\\nloss or discomfiture in the event of some future decline in net\\nincome. (The margin above charges may be stated in other ways—\\n512\\n* “It is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a\\nsentence, to be ever in view, and which should be true and appropriate in all\\ntimes and situations. They presented him the words: ‘ And this, too, shall\\npass away.’ How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of pride!—\\nhow consoling in the depths of affliction! ‘And this, too, shall pass away. ’ And\\nyet let us hope it is not quite true. ”—Abraham Lincoln, Address to the Wis-\\nconsin State Agricultural Society, Milwaukee, September 30, 1859, in Abra-\\nham Lincoln: Speeches and Writings, 1859–1865 (Library of America,\\n1985), vol.

Nor does he rely to any controlling\\nextent on his judgment as to whether future earnings will be mate-\\nrially better or poorer than in the past, if he did that, he would have\\nto measure his margin in terms of a carefully projected income\\naccount, instead of emphasizing the margin shown in the past\\nrecord. Here the function of the margin of safety is, in essence, that\\nof rendering unnecessary an accurate estimate of the future. If the\\nmargin is a large one, then it is enough to assume that future earn-\\nings will not fall far below those of the past in order for an investor\\nto feel sufficiently protected against the vicissitudes of time.\\nThe margin of safety for bonds may be calculated, alternatively,\\nby comparing the total value of the enterprise with the amount of\\ndebt. (A similar calculation may be made for a preferred-stock\\nissue.) If the business owes $10 million and is fairly worth $30 mil-\\nlion, there is room for a shrinkage of two-thirds in value—at least\\ntheoretically—before the bondholders will suffer loss. The amount\\nof this extra value, or “cushion,” above the debt may be approxi-\\nmated by using the average market price of the junior stock issues\\nover a period of years. Since average stock prices are generally\\nrelated to average earning power, the margin of “enterprise value”\\nover debt and the margin of earnings over charges will in most\\ncases yield similar results.\\nSo much for the margin-of-safety concept as applied to “fixed-\\nvalue investments.” Can it be carried over into the field of common\\nstocks? Yes, but with some necessary modifications.\\nThere are instances where a common stock may be considered\\nsound because it enjoys a margin of safety as large as that of a good\\nbond. This will occur, for example, when a company has outstand-\\ning only common stock that under depression conditions is selling\\nfor less than the amount of bonds that could safely be issued\\nagainst its property and earning power.* That was the position of a\\n“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment 513\\n* “Earning power” is Graham’s term for a company’s potential profits or, as\\nhe puts it, the amount that a firm “might be expected to earn year after year'),\n",

The\\ngrowth-stock buyer relies on an expected earning power that is\\ngreater than the average shown in the past. Thus he may be said to\\nsubstitute these expected earnings for the past record in calculating\\nhis margin of safety.

For\\nsuch favored issues the market has a tendency to set prices that\\nwill not be adequately protected by a conservative projection of\\nfuture earnings. (It is a basic rule of prudent investment that all\\nestimates, when they differ from past performance, must err at\\nleast slightly on the side of understatement.)

One is correla-\\ntive with the other. Even with a margin in the investor’s favor, an\\nindividual security may work out badly. For the margin guarantees\\nonly that he has a better chance for profit than for loss—not that\\nloss is impossible. But as the number of such commitments is\\nincreased the more certain does it become that the aggregate of the\\nprofits will exceed the aggregate of the losses. That is the simple\\nbasis of the insurance-underwriting business.\\nDiversification is an established tenet of conservative invest-\\nment. By accepting it so universally, investors are really demon-\\nstrating their acceptance of the margin-of-safety principle, to which\\ndiversification is the companion. This point may be made more col-\\norful by a reference to the arithmetic of roulette. If a man bets $1 on\\na single number, he is paid $35 profit when he wins—but the\\nchances are 37 to 1 that he will lose. He has a “negative margin of\\nsafety.” In his case diversification is foolish. The more numbers he\\nbets on, the smaller his chance of ending with a profit. If he regu-\\nlarly bets $1 on every number (including 0 and 00), he is certain to\\nlose $2 on each turn of the wheel. But suppose the winner received\\n$39 profit instead of $35.

We suggest that the margin-of-safety concept may be\\nused to advantage as the touchstone to distinguish an investment\\noperation from a speculative one.\\nProbably most speculators believe they have the odds in their\\nfavor when they take their chances, and therefore they may lay\\nclaim to a safety margin in their proceedings. Each one has the feel-\\ning that the time is propitious for his purchase, or that his skill is\\nsuperior to the crowd’s, or that his adviser or system is trustwor-\\nthy.

Since only one slot can \\nbe the one into which the ball drops, you would win $35 on that slot, but\\nlose $1 on each of your other 37 slots, for a net loss of $2. That $2 differ-\\nence (or a 5.26% spread on your total $38 bet) is the casino’s “house\\nadvantage, ” ensuring that, on average, roulette players will always lose more\\nthan they win. Just as it is in the roulette player’s interest to bet as seldom as\\npossible, it is in the casino’s interest to keep the roulette wheel spinning.\\nLikewise, the intelligent investor should seek to maximize the number of\\nholdings that offer “a better chance for profit than for loss. ” For most\\ninvestors, diversification is the simplest and cheapest way to widen your\\nmargin of safety.'),\n",

A sufficiently enterprising\\ninvestor could then include an option-warrant operation in his\\nmiscellany of unconventional investments.1\\nTo Sum Up\\nInvestment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike. It is\\namazing to see how many capable businessmen try to operate in\\nWall Street with complete disregard of all the sound principles\\nthrough which they have gained success in their own undertak-\\nings. Yet every corporate security may best be viewed, in the first\\ninstance, as an ownership interest in, or a claim against, a specific\\nbusiness enterprise. And if a person sets out to make profits from\\nsecurity purchases and sales, he is embarking on a business ven-\\nture of his own, which must be run in accordance with accepted\\nbusiness principles if it is to have a chance of success.\\nThe first and most obvious of these principles is, “Know what\\nyou are doing—know your business.” For the investor this means:\\nDo not try to make “business profits” out of securities—that is,\\nreturns in excess of normal interest and dividend income—unless\\nyou know as much about security values as you would need to\\nknow about the value of merchandise that you proposed to manu-\\nfacture or deal in.\\nA second business principle: “Do not let anyone else run your\\nbusiness, unless (1) you can supervise his performance with ade-\\nquate care and comprehension or (2) you have unusually strong rea-\\nsons for placing implicit confidence in his integrity and ability.” For\\nthe investor this rule should determine the conditions under which\\nhe will permit someone else to decide what is done with his money.\\nA third business principle: “Do not enter upon an operation—\\nthat is, manufacturing or trading in an item—unless a reliable cal-\\nculation shows that it has a fair chance to yield a reasonable profit.\\nIn particular, keep away from ventures in which you have little to\\ngain and much to lose.” For the enterprising investor this means\\nthat his operations for profit should be based not on optimism but\\non arithmetic. For every investor it means that when he limits his\\nreturn to a small figure—as formerly, at least, in a conventional\\nbond or preferred stock—he must demand convincing evidence\\nthat he is not risking a substantial part of his principal.\\n“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment 523'),\n",

But while the proba-\\nbilities in Pascal’s wager are a toss-up, the consequences are per-\\nfectly clear and utterly certain. As Bernstein explains:\\nSuppose you act as though God is and [you] lead a life of virtue and\\nabstinence, when in fact there is no god.

I\\nshould add that all these records have been audited. And I should\\nfurther add that I have known many of those who have invested\\nwith these managers, and the checks received by those participants\\nover the years have matched the stated records.\\nBefore we begin this examination, I would like you to imagine a\\nnational coin-flipping contest. Let’s assume we get 225 million\\nAmericans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a\\ndollar. They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call the\\nflip of a coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those who\\ncalled wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequent\\nday the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line.\\nAfter ten flips on ten mornings, there will be approximately\\n220,000 people in the United States who have correctly called ten\\nflips in a row. They each will have won a little over $1,000.\\nNow this group will probably start getting a little puffed up\\nabout this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be mod-\\nest, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive\\nmembers of the opposite sex what their technique is, and what\\nmarvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping.\\nAssuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards\\nfrom the losers, in another ten days we will have 215 people who\\nhave successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who,\\nby this exercise, each have turned one dollar into a little over \\n$1 million. $225 million would have been lost, $225 million would\\nhave been won.\\nBy then, this group will really lose their heads. They will proba-\\nbly write books on “How I Turned a Dollar into a Million in\\nTwenty Days Working Thirty Seconds a Morning.” Worse yet,\\nthey’ll probably start jetting around the country attending semi-\\nnars on efficient coin-flipping and tackling skeptical professors\\nwith, “If it can’t be done, why are there 215 of us?”\\nBut then some business school professor will probably be \\nrude enough to bring up the fact that if 225 million orangutans \\n538 Appendixes'),\n",

So you would\\nprobably go out and ask the zookeeper about what he’s feeding\\nthem, whether they had special exercises, what books they read,\\nand who knows what else. That is, if you found any really extraor-\\ndinary concentrations of success, you might want to see if you\\ncould identify concentrations of unusual characteristics that might\\nbe causal factors.\\nScientific inquiry naturally follows such a pattern. If you were\\ntrying to analyze possible causes of a rare type of cancer—with,\\nsay, 1,500 cases a year in the United States—and you found that 400\\nof them occurred in some little mining town in Montana, you\\nwould get very interested in the water there, or the occupation of\\nthose afflicted, or other variables. You know that it’s not random\\nchance that 400 come from a small area. You would not necessarily\\nknow the causal factors, but you would know where to search.\\nI submit to you that there are ways of defining an origin other\\nthan geography. In addition to geographical origins, there can be\\nwhat I call an intellectual origin. I think you will find that a dispro-\\nportionate number of successful coin-flippers in the investment\\nworld came from a very small intellectual village that could be\\ncalled Graham-and-Doddsville. A concentration of winners that\\nsimply cannot be explained by chance can be traced to this particu-\\nlar intellectual village.\\nConditions could exist that would make even that concentration\\nunimportant. Perhaps 100 people were simply imitating the coin-\\nflipping call of some terribly persuasive personality. When he\\ncalled heads, 100 followers automatically called that coin the same\\nway. If the leader was part of the 215 left at the end, the fact that\\n100 came from the same intellectual origin would mean nothing.\\nYou would simply be identifying one case as a hundred cases.

The patriarch has merely set forth the intellectual\\ntheory for making coin-calling decisions, but each student has\\ndecided on his own manner of applying the theory.\\nThe common intellectual theme of the investors from Graham-\\nand-Doddsville is this: they search for discrepancies between the\\nvalueof a business and the price of small pieces of that business in\\nthe market. Essentially, they exploit those discrepancies without\\nthe efficient market theorist’s concern as to whether the stocks are\\nbought on Monday or Thursday, or whether it is January or July,\\netc. Incidentally, when businessmen buy businesses—which is just\\nwhat our Graham & Dodd investors are doing through the\\nmedium of marketable stocks—I doubt that many are cranking\\ninto their purchase decision the day of the week or the month in\\nwhich the transaction is going to occur.

When first written by Benjamin Graham in 1972, all the\\ninformation therein was correct. However, intervening developments\\nhave rendered this document inaccurate for today’s purposes. Follow-\\ning Graham’s original Appendix 2 is a revised and updated version of\\n“The Basics of Investment Taxation, ” which brings the reader up-to-\\ndate on the relevant rules.\\nRule 1—Interest and Dividends\\nInterest and dividends are taxable as ordinary income except (a)\\nincome received from state, municipal, and similar obligations,\\nwhich are free from Federal tax but may be subject to state tax, (b)\\ndividends representing a return of capital, (c) certain dividends\\npaid by investment companies (see below), and (d) the first $100 of\\nordinary domestic-corporation dividends.\\nRule 2—Capital Gains and Losses\\nShort-term capital gains and losses are merged to obtain net\\nshort-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains and losses\\nare merged to obtain the net long-term capital gain or loss. If the\\nnet short-term capital gain exceeds the net long-term capital loss,\\n100 per cent of such excess shall be included in income. The maxi-\\nmum tax thereon is 25% up to $50,000 of such gains and 35% on the\\nbalance.\\nA net capital loss (the amount exceeding capital gains) is\\ndeductible from ordinary income to a maximum of $1,000 in the\\ncurrent year and in each of the next five years. Alternatively,\\nunused losses may be applied at any time to offset capital gains.\\n(Carry-overs of losses taken before 1970 are treated more liberally\\nthan later losses.)\\nNote Concerning “Regulated Investment Companies”\\nMost investment funds (“investment companies”) take advan-\\ntage of special provisions of the tax law, which enable them to be\\nAppendixes 561'),\n",

Thus if they make long-term\\nsecurity profits they can distribute these as “capital-gain divi-\\ndends,” which are reported by their shareholders in the same way\\nas long-term gains.

Alternatively, such a company may elect to pay the 25% tax\\nfor the account of its shareholders and then retain the balance of\\nthe capital gains without distributing them as capital-gain divi-\\ndends.\\n3. The Basics of Investment Taxation (Updated as of 2003)\\nInterest and Dividends\\nInterest and dividends are taxed at your ordinary-income tax rate\\nexcept (a) interest received from municipal bonds, which is free from\\nFederal income tax but may be subject to state tax, (b) dividends rep-\\nresenting a return of capital, and (c) long-term capital-gain distribu-\\ntions paid by mutual funds (see below). Private-activity municipal\\nbonds, even within a mutual fund, may subject you to the Federal alter-\\nnative minimum tax.\\nCapital Gains and Losses\\nShort-term capital gains and losses are merged to obtain net short-\\nterm capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains and losses are\\nmerged to determine your net long-term capital gain or loss. If your net\\nshort-term capital gain exceeds the net long-term capital loss, that\\nexcess is counted as ordinary income. If there is a net long-term capi-\\ntal gain, it is taxed at the favorable capital gains rate, generally 20%—\\nwhich will fall to 18% for investments purchased after December 31,\\n2000, and held for more than five years.\\nA net capital loss is deductible from ordinary income to a maxim-\\num of $3,000 in the current year. Any capital losses in excess of\\n$3,000 may be applied in later tax years to offset future capital \\ngains.\\nMutual Funds\\nAs “regulated investment companies, ” nearly all mutual funds take\\nadvantage of special provisions of the tax law that exempt them from\\n562 Appendixes'),\n",

The New Speculation in Common Stocks1\\nWhat I shall have to say will reflect the spending of many years\\nin Wall Street, with their attendant varieties of experience. This has\\nincluded the recurrent advent of new conditions, or a new atmo-\\nsphere, which challenge the value of experience itself. It is true that\\none of the elements that distinguish economics, finance, and secu-\\nrity analysis from other practical disciplines is the uncertain valid-\\nity of past phenomena as a guide to the present and future. Yet we\\nhave no right to reject the lessons of the past until we have at least\\nstudied and understood them. My address today is an effort\\ntoward such understanding in a limited field—in particular, an\\nendeavor to point out some contrasting relationships between the\\npresent and the past in our underlying attitudes toward invest-\\nment and speculation in common stocks.\\nLet me start with a summary of my thesis. In the past the specu-\\nlative elements of a common stock resided almost exclusively in\\nthe company itself; they were due to uncertainties, or fluctuating\\nelements, or downright weaknesses in the industry, or the corpora-\\ntion’s individual setup. These elements of speculation still exist, of\\ncourse; but it may be said that they have been sensibly diminished\\nby a number of long-term developments to which I shall refer. But\\nin revenge a new and major element of speculation has been intro-\\nduced into the common-stock arena from outside the companies. It\\ncomes from the attitude and viewpoint of the stock-buying public\\nand their advisers—chiefly us security analysts. This attitude may\\nbe described in a phrase: primary emphasis upon future expecta-\\ntions.\\nNothing will appear more logical and natural to this audience\\nthan the idea that a common stock should be valued and priced\\nAppendixes 563'),\n",

Yet this simple-appearing concept carries with it a number\\nof paradoxes and pitfalls. For one thing, it obliterates a good part of\\nthe older, well-established distinctions between investment and\\nspeculation. The dictionary says that “speculate” comes from the\\nLatin “specula,” a lookout. Thus it was the speculator who looked\\nout and saw future developments coming before other people did.\\nBut today, if the investor is shrewd or well advised, he too must\\nhave his lookout on the future, or rather he mounts into a common\\nlookout where he rubs elbows with the speculator.\\nSecondly, we find that, for the most part, companies with the\\nbest investment characteristics—i.e., the best credit rating—are the\\nones which are likely to attract the largest speculative interest in\\ntheir common stocks, since everyone assumes they are guaranteed\\na brilliant future. Thirdly, the concept of future prospects, and par-\\nticularly of continued growth in the future, invites the application\\nof formulas out of higher mathematics to establish the present\\nvalue of the favored issues. But the combination of precise formu-\\nlas with highly imprecise assumptions can be used to establish, or\\nrather to justify, practically any value one wishes, however high,\\nfor a really outstanding issue. But, paradoxically, that very fact on\\nclose examination will be seen to imply that no one value, or rea-\\nsonably narrow range of values, can be counted on to establish and\\nmaintain itself for a given growth company; hence at times the\\nmarket may conceivably value the growth component at a strik-\\ninglylow figure.\\nReturning to my distinction between the older and newer spec-\\nulative elements in common stock, we might characterize them by\\ntwo outlandish but convenient words, viz.: endogenous and exoge-\\nnous. Let me illustrate briefly the old-time speculative common\\nstock, as distinguished from an investment stock, by some data\\nrelating to American Can and Pennsylvania Railroad in 1911–1913.\\n(These appear in Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd, Security\\nAnalysis, McGraw-Hill, 1940, pp. 2–3.)\\nIn those three years the price range of “Pennsy” moved only\\nbetween 53 and 65, or between 12.2 and 15 times its average earn-\\nings for the period. It showed steady profits, was paying a reliable\\n$3 dividend, and investors were sure that it was backed by well\\nover its par of $50 in tangible assets.

Thus American Can common was a representative\\nspeculative issue, because American Can Company was then a\\nspeculatively capitalized enterprise in a fluctuating and uncertain\\nindustry. Actually, American Can had a far more brilliant long-\\nterm future than Pennsylvania Railroad; but not only was this fact\\nnot suspected by investors or speculators in those days, but even if\\nit had been it would probably have been put aside by the investors\\nas basically irrelevant to investment policies and programs in the\\nyears 1911–1913.\\nNow, to expose you to the development through time of the\\nimportance of long-term prospects for investments. I should like to\\nuse as my example our most spectacular giant industrial enter-\\nprise—none other than International Business Machines, which\\nlast year entered the small group of companies with $1 billion of\\nsales. May I introduce one or two autobiographical notes here, in\\norder to inject a little of the personal touch into what otherwise\\nwould be an excursion into cold figures? In 1912 I had left college\\nfor a term to take charge of a research project for U.S. Express Com-\\npany. We set out to find the effect on revenues of a proposed revo-\\nlutionary new system of computing express rates. For this purpose\\nwe used the so-called Hollerith machines, leased out by the then\\nComputing-Tabulating-Recording Company. They comprised card\\npunches, card sorters, and tabulators—tools almost unknown to\\nbusinessmen, then, and having their chief application in the Cen-\\nsus Bureau. I entered Wall Street in 1914, and the next year the\\nbonds and common stock of C.-T.-R. Company were listed on the\\nNew York Stock Exchange. Well, I had a kind of sentimental inter-\\nest in that enterprise, and besides I considered myself a sort of\\ntechnological expert on their products, being one of the few finan-\\ncial people who had seen and used them. So early in 1916 I went to\\nthe head of my firm, known as Mr. A. N., and pointed out to him\\nthat C.-T.-R. stock was selling in the middle 40s (for 105,000\\nshares); that it had earned $6.50 in 1915; that its book value—\\nAppendixes 565'),\n",

Mr. A. N. looked at me\\npityingly. “Ben,” said he, “do not mention that company to me\\nagain. I would not touch it with a ten-foot pole. [His favorite\\nexpression.] Its 6 per cent bonds are selling in the low 80s and they\\nare no good. So how can the stock be any good? Everybody knows\\nthere is nothing behind it but water.” (Glossary: In those days that\\nwas the ultimate of condemnation. It meant that the asset account\\nof the balance sheet was fictitious. Many industrial companies—\\nnotably U.S. Steel—despite their $100 par, represented nothing but\\nwater, concealed in a written-up plant account. Since they had\\n“nothing” to back them but earning power and future prospects,\\nno self-respecting investor would give them a second thought.)\\nI returned to my statistician’s cubbyhole, a chastened young\\nman. Mr. A. N. was not only experienced and successful, but\\nextremely shrewd as well. So much was I impressed by his sweep-\\ning condemnation of Computing-Tabulating-Recording that I\\nnever bought a share of it in my life, not even after its name was\\nchanged to International Business Machines in 1926.\\nNow let us take a look at the same company with its new name\\nin 1926, a year of pretty high stock markets. At that time it first\\nrevealed the good-will item in its balance sheet, in the rather large\\nsum of $13.6 million. A. N. had been right. Practically every dollar\\nof the so-called equity behind the common in 1915 had been noth-\\ning but water. However, since that time the company had made an\\nimpressive record under the direction of T. L. Watson, Sr. Its net\\nhad risen from $691,000 to $3.7 million—over fivefold—a greater\\npercentage gain than it was to make in any subsequent eleven-year\\nperiod. It had built up a nice tangible equity for the common, and\\nhad split it 3.6 for one. It had established a $3 dividend rate for the\\nnew stock, while earnings were $6.39 thereon. You might have\\nexpected the 1926 stock market to have been pretty enthusiastic\\nabout a company with such a growth history and so strong a trade\\nposition. Let us see. The price range for that year was 31 low, 59\\nhigh. At the average of 45 it was selling at the same 7-times multi-\\nplier of earnings and the same 6.7 per cent dividend yield as it had\\ndone in 1915. At its low of 31 it was not far in excess of its tangible\\nbook value, and in that respect was far more conservatively priced\\nthan eleven years earlier.\\n566 Appendixes'),\n",

In\\n1936 net expanded to twice the 1926 figures, and the average multi-\\nplier rose from 7 to 171⁄2. From 1936 to 1946 the gain was 2 1⁄2 times,\\nbut the average multiplier in 1946 remained at 17 1⁄2. Then the pace\\naccelerated. The 1956 net was nearly 4 times that of 1946, and the\\naverage multiplier rose to 321⁄2. Last year, with a further gain in net,\\nthe multiplier rose again to an average of 42, if we do not count the\\nunconsolidated equity in the foreign subsidiary.\\nWhen we examine these recent price figures with care we see\\nsome interesting analogies and contrasts with those of forty years\\nearlier. The one-time scandalous water, so prevalent in the balance\\nsheets of industrial companies, has all been squeezed out—first by\\ndisclosure and then by writeoffs. But a different kind of water has\\nbeen put back into the valuation by the stock market—by investors\\nand speculators themselves. When IBM now sells at 7 times its\\nbook value, instead of 7 times earnings, the effect is practically the\\nsame as if it had no book value at all.

One of my older\\nfriends said to me then: “Ben, you may think you are a great guy to\\nsupply those missing figures, but Wall Street is going to thank you\\nfor nothing.

These were\\nMystery, Manipulation, and (thin) Margins. But we security ana-\\nlysts have ourselves been creating valuation approaches which are\\nso speculative in themselves as to pretty well take the place of\\nthose older speculative factors. Do we not have our own “3M’s”\\nnow—none other than Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing\\nCompany—and does not this common stock illustrate perfectly the\\nnew speculation as contrasted with the old? Consider a few fig-\\nures. When M. M. & M. common sold at 101 last year the market\\nwas valuing it at 44 times 1956 earnings, which happened to show\\nno increase to speak of in 1957. The enterprise itself was valued at\\n$1.7 billion, of which $200 million was covered by net assets, and a\\ncool $11⁄2 billion represented the market’s appraisal of “good will.”\\nWe do not know the process of calculation by which that valuation\\nof good will was arrived at; we do know that a few months later\\nthe market revised this appraisal downward by some $450 million,\\nor about 30 per cent. Obviously it is impossible to calculate accu-\\nrately the intangible component of a splendid company such as\\nthis. It follows as a kind of mathematical law that the more impor-\\ntant the good will or future earning-power factor the more uncer-\\ntain becomes the true value of the enterprise, and therefore the\\nmore speculative inherently the common stock.\\nIt may be well to recognize a vital difference that has developed\\nin the valuation of these intangible factors, when we compare ear-\\nlier times with today.

A good industrial company might be\\nrequired to earn between 6 per cent and 8 per cent on its tangible\\nassets, represented typically by bonds and preferred stock; but its\\nexcess earnings, or the intangible assets they gave rise to, would be\\nvalued on, say, a 15 per cent basis. (You will find approximately\\nthese ratios in the initial offering of Woolworth preferred and com-\\nmon stock in 1911, and in numerous others.) But what has hap-\\npened since the 1920s? Essentially the exact reverse of these\\nrelationships may now be seen. A company must now typically\\nearn about 10 per cent on its common equity to have it sell in the\\naverage market at full book value. But its excess earnings, above 10\\nper cent on capital, are usually valued more liberally, or at a higher\\nmultiplier, than the base earnings required to support the book\\nvalue in the market. Thus a company earning 15 per cent on the\\nequity may well sell at 131⁄2 times earnings, or twice its net assets.\\nThis would mean that the first 10 per cent earned on capital is val-\\nued at only 10 times, but the next 5 per cent—what used to be\\ncalled the “excess”—is actually valued at 20 times.\\nNow there is a logical reason for this reversal in valuation proce-\\ndure, which is related to the newer emphasis on growth expecta-\\ntions. Companies that earn a high return on capital are given these\\nliberal appraisals not only because of the good profitability itself,\\nand the relative stability associated with it, but perhaps even more\\ncogently because high earnings on capital generally go hand in\\nhand with a good growth record and prospects. Thus what is really\\npaid for nowadays in the case of highly profitable companies is not\\nthe good will in the old and restricted sense of an established name\\nand a profitable business, but rather their assumed superior expec-\\ntations of increased profits in the future.\\nThis brings me to one or two additional mathematical aspects of\\nthe new attitude toward common-stock valuations, which I shall\\ntouch on merely in the form of brief suggestions. If, as many tests\\nshow, the earnings multiplier tends to increase with profitability—\\ni.e., as the rate of return on book value increases—then the arith-\\nmetical consequence of this feature is that value tends to increase\\ndirectly as the square of the earnings, but inversely the book value.\\nThus in an important and very real sense tangible assets have\\nbecome a drag on average market value rather than a source\\nAppendixes 569'),\n",

Take a far from extreme illustration. If Company A earns $4\\na share on a $20 book value, and Company B also $4 a share on\\n$100 book value, Company A is almost certain to sell at a higher\\nmultiplier, and hence at higher price than Company B—say $60 for\\nCompany A shares and $35 for Company B shares. Thus it would\\nnot be inexact to declare that the $80 per share of greater assets for\\nCompany B are responsible for the $25 per share lower market\\nprice, since the earnings per share are assumed to be equal.\\nBut more important than the foregoing is the general relation-\\nship between mathematics and the new approach to stock values.\\nGiven the three ingredients of (a) optimistic assumptions as to the\\nrate of earnings growth, (b) a sufficiently long projection of this\\ngrowth into the future, and (c) the miraculous workings of com-\\npound interest—lo! the security analyst is supplied with a new\\nkind of philosopher’s stone which can produce or justify any\\ndesired valuation for a really “good stock.” I have commented in a\\nrecent article in the Analysts’ Journal on the vogue of higher mathe-\\nmatics in bull markets, and quoted David Durand’s exposition of\\nthe striking analogy between value calculations of growth stocks\\nand the famous Petersburg Paradox, which has challenged and\\nconfused mathematicians for more than two hundred years. The\\npoint I want to make here is that there is a special paradox in the\\nrelationship between mathematics and investment attitudes on\\ncommon stocks, which is this: Mathematics is ordinarily consid-\\nered as producing precise and dependable results; but in the stock\\nmarket the more elaborate and abstruse the mathematics the more\\nuncertain and speculative are the conclusions we draw therefrom.\\nIn forty-four years of Wall Street experience and study I have never\\nseen dependable calculations made about common-stock values, or\\nrelated investment policies, that went beyond simple arithmetic or\\nthe most elementary algebra. Whenever calculus is brought in, \\nor higher algebra, you could take it as a warning signal that the\\noperator was trying to substitute theory for experience, and usu-\\nally also to give to speculation the deceptive guise of investment.\\nThe older ideas of common-stock investment may seem quite\\nnaïve to the sophisticated security analyst of today.

Yet one might argue, perversely, that precisely because the\\nold-time investor did not concentrate on future capital apprecia-\\ntion he was virtually guaranteeing to himself that he would have it,\\nat least in the field of industrial stocks. And, conversely, today’s\\ninvestor is so concerned with anticipating the future that he is\\nalready paying handsomely for it in advance. Thus what he has\\nprojected with so much study and care may actually happen and\\nstill not bring him any profit. If it should fail to materialize to the\\ndegree expected he may in fact be faced with a serious temporary\\nand perhaps even permanent loss.\\nWhat lessons—again using the pretentious title of my 1920 pam-\\nphlet—can the analyst of 1958 learn from this linking of past with\\ncurrent attitudes? Not much of value, one is inclined to say. We can\\nlook back nostalgically to the good old days when we paid only for\\nthe present and could get the future for nothing—an “all this and\\nHeaven too” combination. Shaking our heads sadly we mutter,\\n“Those days are gone forever.” Have not investors and security\\nanalysts eaten of the tree of knowledge of good and evil prospects?\\nBy so doing have they not permanently expelled themselves from\\nthat Eden where promising common stocks at reasonable prices\\ncould be plucked off the bushes? Are we doomed always to run the\\nrisk either of paying unreasonably high prices for good quality and\\nprospects, or of getting poor quality and prospects when we pay\\nwhat seems a reasonable price?\\nIt certainly looks that way. Yet one cannot be sure even of that\\npessimistic dilemma. Recently, I did a little research in the long-\\nterm history of that towering enterprise, General Electric—stimu-\\nlated by the arresting chart of fifty-nine years of earnings and\\ndividends appearing in their recently published 1957 Report. These\\nfigures are not without their surprises for the knowledgeable ana-\\nlyst. For one thing they show that prior to 1947 the growth of G. E.\\nwas fairly modest and quite irregular. The 1946 earnings, per share\\nadjusted, were only 30 per cent higher than in 1902—52 cents ver-\\n572 Appendixes'),\n",

Yet the price-earnings ratio rose from 9 times\\nin 1910 and 1916 to 29 times in 1936 and again in 1946. One might\\nsay, of course, that the 1946 multiplier at least showed the well-\\nknown prescience of shrewd investors. We analysts were able to\\nforesee then the really brilliant period of growth that was looming\\nahead in the next decade. Maybe so. But some of you remember\\nthat the next year, 1947, which established an impressive new high\\nfor G.E.’s per-share earnings, was marked also by an extraordinary\\nfall in the price-earnings ratio. At its low of 32 (before the 3-for-1\\nsplit) G.E. actually sold again at only 9 times its current earnings\\nand its average price for the year was only about 10 times earnings.\\nOur crystal ball certainly clouded over in the short space of twelve\\nmonths.\\nThis striking reversal took place only eleven years ago. It casts\\nsome little doubt in my mind as to the complete dependability of\\nthe popular belief among analysts that prominent and promising\\ncompanies will now always sell at high price-earnings ratios—that\\nthis is a fundamental fact of life for investors and they may as well\\naccept and like it. I have no desire at all to be dogmatic on this\\npoint. All I can say is that it is not settled in my mind, and each of\\nyou must seek to settle it for yourself.\\nBut in my concluding remarks I can say something definite\\nabout the structure of the market for various types of common\\nstocks, in terms of their investment and speculative characteristics.\\nIn the old days the investment character of a common stock was\\nmore or less the same as, or proportionate with, that of the enter-\\nprise itself, as measured quite well by its credit rating. The lower\\nthe yield on its bonds or preferred, the more likely was the com-\\nmon to meet all the criteria for a satisfactory investment, and the\\nsmaller the element of speculation involved in its purchase. This\\nrelationship, between the speculative ranking of the common and\\nthe investment rating of the company, could be graphically\\nexpressed pretty much as a straight line descending from left to\\nright. But nowadays I would describe the graph as U-shaped. At\\nthe left, where the company itself is speculative and its credit low,\\nthe common stock is of course highly speculative, just as it has\\nalways been in the past.

The initial market value of the\\nbonds appears to have been only 43% of par, while the warrants\\nwere quoted at $10 per NVF share involved. This meant that the\\nSharon holders got only $30 worth of bonds but $15 worth of war-\\nrants for each share turned in, a total of $45 per share. (This was\\nabout the average price of Sharon in 1968, and also its closing price\\nfor the year.) The book value of Sharon was $60 per share. The dif-\\nference between this book value and the market value of Sharon\\nstock amounted to about $21 million on the 1,415,000 shares of\\nSharon acquired.\\n2. The accounting treatment was designed to accomplish three\\nthings: (a) To treat the issuance of the bonds as equivalent to a\\n“sale” thereof at 43, giving the company an annual deduction from\\nincome for amortization of the huge bond discount of $54 million.\\n(Actually it would be charging itself about 15% annual interest on\\nthe “proceeds” of the $99 million debenture issue.) (b) To offset this\\nbond-discount charge by an approximately equal “profit,” consist-\\ning of a credit to income of one-tenth of the difference between the\\ncost price of 45 for the Sharon stock and its book value of 60. (This\\nwould correspond, in reverse fashion, to the required practice of\\ncharging income each year with a part of the price paid for acquisi-\\ntions in excess of the book value of the assets acquired.) (c) The\\nbeauty of this arrangement would be that the company could save\\ninitially about $900,000 a year, or $1 per share, in income taxes from\\nthese two annual entries, because the amortization of bond dis-\\ncount could be deducted from taxable income but the amortization\\nof “excess of equity over cost” did not have to be included in tax-\\nable income.\\n3. This accounting treatment is reflected in both the consoli-\\ndated income account and the consolidated balance sheet of NVF\\nfor 1969, and pro forma for 1968. Since a good part of the cost of\\nSharon stock was to be treated as paid for by warrants, it was nec-\\nessary to show the initial market value of the warrants as part of\\nthe common-stock capital figure. Thus in this case, as in no other\\nthat we know, the warrants were assigned a substantial value in\\nthe balance sheet, namely $22 million+ (but only in an explanatory\\nnote).\\nAppendixes 577'),\n",

Thus\\nthey are still acting mainly not on their own judgment but on that of\\nthe house selling them the security or on the recommendation of the\\nindividual salesman or account executive.\\nChapter 11. Security Analysis for the Lay Investor: \\nGeneral Approach\\n1. Our textbook, Security Analysis by Benjamin Graham, David L. Dodd,\\nSidney Cottle, and Charles Tatham (McGraw-Hill, 4th ed., 1962),\\nretains the title originally chosen in 1934, but it covers much of the\\nscope of financial analysis.\\n2. With Charles McGolrick, Harper & Row, 1964, reissued by Harper-\\nBusiness, 1998.\\n3. These figures are from Salomon Bros., a large New York bond house.\\n4. At least not by the great body of security analysts and investors.\\nExceptional analysts, who can tell in advance what companies are\\nlikely to deserve intensive study and have the facilities and capability\\nto make it, may have continued success with this work. For details of\\nsuch an approach see Philip Fisher, Common Stocks and Uncommon\\nProfits, Harper & Row, 1960.\\n5. On p. 295 we set forth a formula relating multipliers to the rate of\\nexpected growth.\\n6. Part of the fireworks in the price of Chrysler was undoubtedly\\ninspired by two two-for-one stock splits taking place in the single\\nyear 1963—an unprecedented phenomenon for a major company. In\\nthe early 1980s, under Lee Iacocca, Chrysler did a three-peat, coming\\nback from the brink of bankruptcy to become one of the best-performing\\nstocks in America. However, identifying managers who can lead great\\ncorporate comebacks is not as easy as it seems. When Al Dunlap took\\nover Sunbeam Corp. in 1996 after restructuring Scott Paper Co. (and\\ndriving its stock price up 225% in 18 months), Wall Street hailed him as\\nlittle short of the Second Coming. Dunlap turned out to be a sham who\\nused improper accounting and false financial statements to mislead\\nSunbeam’s investors—including the revered money managers Michael\\nPrice and Michael Steinhardt, who had hired him. For a keen dissection\\nof Dunlap’s career, see John A. Byrne, Chainsaw (HarperCollins, New\\nYork, 1999).\\n584 Endnotes'),\n",

Note that we do not suggest that this formula gives the “true value”\\nof a growth stock, but only that it approximates the results of the\\nmore elaborate calculations in vogue.\\nChapter 12. Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings\\n1. Our recommended method of dealing with the warrant dilution is\\ndiscussed below. We prefer to consider the market value of the war-\\nrants as an addition to the current market price of the common stock\\nas a whole.\\nChapter 13. A Comparison of Four Listed Companies\\n1. In March 1972, Emery sold at 64 times its 1971 earnings!\\nChapter 14. Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor\\n1. Because of numerous stock splits, etc., through the years, the actual\\naverage price of the DJIA list was about $53 per share in early 1972.\\n2. In 1960 only two of the 29 industrial companies failed to show current\\nassets equal to twice current liabilities, and only two failed to have\\nnet current assets exceeding their debt. By December 1970 the num-\\nber in each category had grown from two to twelve.\\n3. But note that their combined market action from December 1970 to\\nearly 1972 was poorer than that of the DJIA. This demonstrates once\\nagain that no system or formula will guarantee superior market\\nresults. Our requirements “guarantee” only that the portfolio-buyer is\\ngetting his money’s worth.\\n4. As a consequence we must exclude the majority of gas pipeline\\nstocks, since these enterprises are heavily bonded. The justification\\nfor this setup is the underlying structure of purchase contracts which\\n“guarantee” bond payments; but the considerations here may be too\\ncomplicated for the needs of a defensive investor.\\nChapter 15. Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor\\n1. Mutual Funds and Other Institutional Investors: A New Perspective,\\nI. Friend, M. Blume, and J. Crockett, McGraw-Hill, 1970. We should\\nadd that the 1966–1970 results of many of the funds we studied were\\nEndnotes 585'),\n",

Personal note: Many years before the stock-market pyrotechnics in\\nthat particular company the author was its “financial vice-president”\\nat the princely salary of $3,000 per annum. It was then really in the\\nfireworks business. In early 1929, Graham became a financial vice pres-\\nident of Unexcelled Manufacturing Co., the nation’s largest producer of\\nfireworks. Unexcelled later became a diversified chemical company and\\nno longer exists in independent form.\\n3. The Guide does not show multipliers above 99. Most such would be\\nmathematical oddities, caused by earnings just above the zero point.\\nChapter 16. Convertible Issues and Warrants\\n1. This point is well illustrated by an offering of two issues of Ford\\nMotor Finance Co. made simultaneously in November 1971. One was\\na 20-year nonconvertible bond, yielding 71⁄2%. The other was a 25-year\\nbond, subordinated to the first in order of claim and yielding only\\n41⁄2%; but it was made convertible into Ford Motor stock, against its\\nthen price of 68 1⁄2. To obtain the conversion privilege the buyer gave\\nup 40% of income and accepted a junior-creditor position.\\n2. Note that in late 1971 Studebaker-Worthington common sold as low\\nas 38 while the $5 preferred sold at or about 77. The spread had thus\\ngrown from 2 to 20 points during the year, illustrating once more the\\ndesirability of such switches and also the tendency of the stock mar-\\nket to neglect arithmetic. (Incidentally the small premium of the pre-\\nferred over the common in December 1970 had already been made up\\nby its higher dividend.)\\nChapter 17. Four Extremely Instructive Case Histories\\n1. See, for example, the article “Six Flags at Half Mast,” by Dr. A. J.\\nBriloff, in Barron’s, January 11, 1971.\\nChapter 18. A Comparison of Eight Pairs of Companies\\n1. The reader will recall from p. 434 above that AAA Enterprises tried to\\nenter this business, but quickly failed. Here Graham is making a pro-\\n586 Endnotes'),\n",

The new competition, in turn, will\\nlead to lower prices and smaller profits. This crucial point was over-\\nlooked by overenthusiastic Internet stock buyers, who believed that early\\nwinners would sustain their advantage indefinitely.\\nChapter 19. Shareholders and Managements: Dividend Policy\\n1. Analytical studies have shown that in the typical case a dollar paid\\nout in dividends had as much as four times the positive effect on mar-\\nket price as had a dollar of undistributed earnings. This point was\\nwell illustrated by the public-utility group for a number of years\\nbefore 1950. The low-payout issues sold at low multipliers of earn-\\nings, and proved to be especially attractive buys because their divi-\\ndends were later advanced. Since 1950 payout rates have been much\\nmore uniform for the industry.\\nChapter 20. “Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept \\nof Investment\\n1. This argument is supported by Paul Hallingby, Jr., “Speculative\\nOpportunities in Stock-Purchase Warrants,” Analysts’ Journal, third\\nquarter 1947.\\nPostscript\\n1. Veracity requires the admission that the deal almost fell through\\nbecause the partners wanted assurance that the purchase price would\\nbe 100% covered by asset value. A future $300 million or more in mar-\\nket gain turned on, say, $50,000 of accounting items. By dumb luck\\nthey got what they insisted on.\\nAppendixes\\n1.

The problem was that the rich man was\\nnot rich yet, and the poor man was not yet poor. Both were\\njust starting out on their careers, and both were struggling\\nwith money and families. But they had very diﬀerent points\\nof view about money.\\nFor example, one dad would say, “The love of money is\\nthe root of all evil.” The other said, “The lack of money is\\nthe root of all evil.”\\nAs a young boy, having two strong fathers both\\ninﬂuencing me was diﬀicult. I wanted to be a good son and\\nlisten, but the two fathers did not say the same things. The\\ncontrast in their points of view, particularly about money,\\nwas so extreme that I grew curious and intrigued. I began\\nto start thinking for long periods of time about what each\\nwas saying.\\nMuch of my private time was spent reﬂecting, asking\\nmyself questions such as, “Why does he say that?” and then\\nasking the same question of the other dad’s statement. It\\nwould have been much easier to simply say, “Yeah, he’s\\nright. I agree with that.” Or to simply reject the point of\\nview by saying, “The old man doesn’t know what he’s\\ntalking about.” Instead, having two dads whom I loved\\nforced me to think and ultimately choose a way of thinking\\nfor myself. As a process, choosing for myself turned out to\\nbe much more valuable in the long run than simply\\naccepting or rejecting a single point of view.\\nOne of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get\\npoorer, and the middle class struggles in debt is that the\\nsubject of money is taught at home, not in school. Most of us\\nlearn about money from our parents. So what can poor\\nparents tell their child about money? They simply say, “Stay\\nin school and study hard.” The child may graduate with'),\n",

Schools focus on\\nscholastic and professional skills, but not on ﬁnancial skills.\\nThis explains how smart bankers, doctors, and accountants\\nwho earned excellent grades may struggle ﬁnancially all of\\ntheir lives. Our staggering national debt is due in large part\\nto highly educated politicians and government oﬀicials\\nmaking ﬁnancial decisions with little or no training in the\\nsubject of money.\\nToday I often wonder what will soon happen when we\\nhave millions of people who need ﬁnancial and medical\\nassistance. They will be dependent upon their families or\\nthe government for ﬁnancial support. What will happen\\nwhen Medicare and Social Security run out of money? How\\nwill a nation survive if teaching children about money\\ncontinues to be left to parents—most of whom will be, or\\nalready are, poor?\\nBecause I had two inﬂuential fathers, I learned from\\nboth of them. I had to think about each dad’s advice, and in\\ndoing so, I gained valuable insight into the power and eﬀect\\nof one’s thoughts on one’s life. For example, one dad had a\\nhabit of saying, “I can’t aﬀord it.” The other dad forbade\\nthose words to be used. He insisted I ask, “How can I aﬀord\\nit?” One is a statement, and the other is a question. One lets\\nyou oﬀ the hook, and the other forces you to think. My soon-\\nto-be-rich dad would explain that by automatically saying\\nthe words “I can’t aﬀord it,” your brain stops working. By\\nasking the question “How can I aﬀord it?” your brain is put\\nto work. He did not mean that you should buy everything\\nyou want. He was fanatical about exercising your mind, the\\nmost powerful computer in the world. He’d say, “My brain\\ngets stronger every day because I exercise it. The stronger\\nit gets, the more money I can make.” He believed that\\nautomatically saying “I can’t aﬀord it” was a sign of mental\\nlaziness.'),\n",

It is not much\\ndiﬀerent from a person who goes to the gym to exercise on\\na regular basis versus someone who sits on the couch\\nwatching television.

As best as I could tell, Mike and I were the\\nonly poor kids in this school. Mike was also in this school by\\na twist of fate. Someone had drawn a jog in the line for the\\nschool district, and we wound up in school with the rich\\nkids. We weren’t really poor, but we felt as if we were\\nbecause all the other boys had new baseball gloves, new\\nbicycles, new everything.\\nMom and Dad provided us with the basics, like food,\\nshelter, and clothes. But that was about it. My dad used to\\nsay, “If you want something, work for it.” We wanted things,\\nbut there was not much work available for nine-year-old\\nboys.\\n“So what do we do to make money?” Mike asked.\\n“I don’t know,” I said. “But do you want to be my\\npartner?”\\nHe agreed, and so on that Saturday morning, Mike\\nbecame my ﬁrst business partner. We spent all morning'),\n",

It was a singular point\\nof view that made all the diﬀerence over a lifetime.\\nRich dad explained this point of view over and over,\\nwhich I call lesson number one: The poor and the middle\\nclass work for money. The rich have money work for them.\\nOn that bright Saturday morning, I learned a completely\\ndiﬀerent point of view from what I had been taught by my\\npoor dad. At the age of nine, I understood that both dads\\nwanted me to learn. Both dads encouraged me to study, but\\nnot the same things.\\nMy highly educated dad recommended that I do what he\\ndid. “Son, I want you to study hard, get good grades, so you\\ncan ﬁnd a safe, secure job with a big company. And make\\nsure it has excellent beneﬁts.” My rich dad wanted me to\\nlearn how money works so I could make it work for me.\\nThese lessons I would learn through life with his\\nguidance, not because of a classroom.\\nMy rich dad continued my ﬁrst lesson, “I’m glad you got\\nangry about working for 10 cents an hour. If you hadn’t got\\nangry and had simply accepted it, I would have to tell you\\nthat I could not teach you. You see, true learning takes\\nenergy, passion, and a burning desire. Anger is a big part of\\nthat formula, for passion is anger and love combined. When\\nit comes to money, most people want to play it safe and feel\\nsecure. So passion does not direct them. Fear does.”\\n“So is that why they’ll take jobs with low pay?” I asked.\\n“Yes,” said rich dad. “Some people say I exploit people\\nbecause I don’t pay as much as the sugar plantation or the'),\n",

But he still has money problems because\\nhe never learned anything about money in school. On top of\\nthat, he believes in working for money.”\\n“And you don’t?” I asked.\\n“No, not really,” said rich dad. “If you want to learn to\\nwork for money, then stay in school. That is a great place to\\nlearn to do that. But if you want to learn how to have money\\nwork for you, then I will teach you that. But only if you want\\nto learn.”\\n“Wouldn’t everyone want to learn that?” I asked.\\n“No,” said rich dad, “simply because it’s easier to learn\\nto work for money, especially if fear is your primary emotion\\nwhen the subject of money is discussed.”\\n“I don’t understand,” I said with a frown.\\n“Don’t worry about that for now. Just know that it’s fear\\nthat keeps most people working at a job: the fear of not\\npaying their bills, the fear of being ﬁred, the fear of not\\nhaving enough money, and the fear of starting over.

Most people become a slave to\\nmoney—and then get angry at their boss.”\\n“Learning to have money work for you is a completely\\ndiﬀerent course of study?” I asked.\\n“Absolutely,” rich dad answered. “Absolutely.”'),\n",

But\\ninstead of shopping with local real estate agents, I began\\nshopping at the bankruptcy attorney’s oﬀice, or the\\ncourthouse steps. In these shopping places, a $75,000\\nhouse could sometimes be bought for $20,000 or less. For\\n$2,000, which was loaned to me from a friend for 90 days\\nfor $200, I gave an attorney a cashier’s check as a down\\npayment. While the acquisition was being processed, I ran\\nan ad advertising a $75,000 house for only $60,000 and no\\nmoney down. The phone rang hard and heavy. Prospective\\nbuyers were screened and once the property was legally\\nmine, all the prospective buyers were allowed to look at the\\nhouse. It was a feeding frenzy.

But playing it safe and balanced on your investment\\nportfolio is not the way successful investors play the game.\\nIf you have little money and you want to be rich, you must\\nﬁrst be focused, not balanced. If you look at any successful\\nperson, at the start they were not balanced. Balanced\\npeople go nowhere. They stay in one spot. To make\\nprogress, you must ﬁrst go unbalanced. Just look at how\\nyou make progress walking.\\nThomas Edison was not balanced. He was focused. Bill\\nGates was not balanced. He was focused. Donald Trump is\\nfocused. George Soros is focused. George Patton did not\\ntake his tanks wide. He focused them and blew through the\\nweak spots in the German line.

Yet we all have inside of us this yearning to\\nhave nice, new, or exciting things.\\nSo to keep that emotion of desire under control, often\\nparents ﬁnd ways of suppressing that desire with guilt. “You\\nonly think about yourself. Don’t you know you have brothers\\nand sisters?” was one of my mom’s favorites. “You want me\\nto buy you what?” was a favorite of my dad. “Do you think\\nwe’re made of money? Do you think money grows on trees?\\nWe’re not rich people, you know.”\\nIt wasn’t so much the words, but the angry guilt trip that\\nwent with the words that got to me.\\nOr the reverse guilt trip was the “I’m sacriﬁcing my life\\nto buy this for you. I’m buying this for you because I never\\nhad this advantage when I was a kid.” I have a neighbor\\nwho is stone-broke but can’t park his car in his garage. The\\ngarage is ﬁlled with toys for his kids. Those spoiled brats\\nget everything they ask for. “I don’t want them to know the\\nfeeling of want” are his everyday words. He has nothing set\\naside for their college or his retirement, but his kids have\\nevery toy ever made. He recently got a new credit card in\\nthe mail and took his kids to visit Las Vegas. “I’m doing it for\\nthe kids,” he said with great sacriﬁce.\\nRich dad believed that the words “I can’t\\naﬀord it” shut down your brain. “How can I\\naﬀord it?” opens up possibilities, excitement,\\nand dreams.'),\n",

It didn’t have\\nto think anymore. “How can I aﬀord it?” opened up the\\nbrain and forced it to think and search for answers.\\nBut most importantly, he felt the words, “I can’t aﬀord\\nit,” were a lie.

Be an Indian giver: the power of getting\\nsomething for nothing\\nWhen the ﬁrst European settlers came to America, they\\nwere taken aback by a cultural practice some American\\nIndians had.

That is where the term\\n“Indian giver” came from, a simple cultural\\nmisunderstanding.\\nIn the world of the asset column, being an Indian giver is\\nvital to wealth. The sophisticated investor’s ﬁrst question is:\\n“How fast do I get my money back?” They also want to know\\nwhat they get for free, also called a “piece of the action.”\\nThat is why the ROI, or return on investment, is so\\nimportant.\\nFor example, I found a small condominium that was in\\nforeclosure a few blocks from where I lived. The bank\\nwanted $60,000, and I submitted a bid for $50,000, which\\nthey took, simply because, along with my bid, was a\\ncashier’s check for $50,000. They realized I was serious.\\nMost investors would say, “Aren’t you tying up a lot of cash?\\nWould it not be better to get a loan on it?” The answer is,\\n“Not in this case.” My investment company uses this\\ncondominium as a vacation rental in the winter months\\nwhen the “snowbirds” come to Arizona.

People who are not\\ninvestors have no idea what it feels like to try to sell\\nsomething. I have had a piece of real estate that I wanted to\\nsell for months. I would have welcomed any oﬀer. They\\ncould have oﬀered me 10 pigs, and I would have been\\nhappy—not at the oﬀer, but just because someone was\\ninterested. I would have countered, maybe for a pig farm in\\nexchange. But that’s how the game works. The game of\\nbuying and selling is fun. Keep that in mind. It’s fun and\\nonly a game. Make oﬀers. Someone might say yes.\\nI always make oﬀers with escape clauses. In real estate, I\\nmake an oﬀer with language that details “subject-to”\\ncontingencies, such as the approval of a business partner.\\nNever specify who the business partner is. Most people\\ndon’t know that my partner is my cat. If they accept the\\noﬀer, and I don’t want the deal, I call home and speak to my\\ncat. I make this ridiculous statement to illustrate how\\nabsurdly easy and simple the game is. So many people\\nmake things too diﬀicult and take it too seriously.\\n• Finding a good deal, the right business, the right\\npeople, the right investors, or whatever is just like'),\n",

Without ﬁnancial training,\\nwe all too often use the standard formulas to get through\\nlife: Work hard, save, borrow, and pay excessive taxes.\\nToday, more than ever, we need better information.\\nI use the following story as an example of a ﬁnancial\\nproblem that confronts many young families today. How do\\nyou aﬀord a good education for your children and provide\\nfor your own retirement? It requires using ﬁnancial\\nintelligence instead of hard work.\\nA friend of mine was griping one day about how hard it\\nwas to save money for his four children’s college\\neducations. He was putting $300 away in a college fund\\neach month and had so far accumulated only about\\n$12,000. He had about 12 more years to save for college\\nsince his oldest child was then six years old.\\nAt the time, the real estate market in Phoenix was\\nterrible. People were giving houses away. I suggested to my\\nfriend that he buy a house with some of the money in his\\ncollege fund. The idea intrigued him, and we began to\\ndiscuss the possibility. His primary concern was that he did\\nnot have credit with the bank to buy another house since he\\nwas so over-extended. I assured him that there were other\\nways to ﬁnance a property rather than through the bank.\\nWe looked for a house for two weeks, a house that would\\nﬁt all our criteria. There were plenty to choose from so'),\n",

Finally, we found a three-bedroom, two-\\nbath home in a prime neighborhood. The owner had been\\ndownsized and needed to sell that day because he and his\\nfamily were moving to California where another job waited.\\nThe owner wanted $102,000, but we oﬀered only $79,000.\\nHe took it immediately and agreed to carry back the loan\\nwith a 10 percent down payment. All my friend had to come\\nup with was $7,900. As soon as the owner moved, my friend\\nput the house up for rent. After all expenses were paid,\\nincluding the mortgage, he put about $125 in his pocket\\neach month.\\nHis plan was to keep the house for 12 years and let the\\nmortgage get paid down faster by applying the extra $125\\nto the principal each month. We ﬁgured that in 12 years, a\\nlarge portion of the mortgage would be paid oﬀ and he\\ncould possibly be clearing $800 a month by the time his\\nﬁrst child went to college. He could also sell the house if it\\nhad appreciated in value.\\nThree years later, the real estate market greatly\\nimproved in Phoenix and he was oﬀered $156,000 for the\\nsame house by the tenant who lived in it. Again, he asked\\nme what I thought. I advised that he sell it, using a 1031\\ntax-deferred exchange.\\nSuddenly, he had nearly $80,000 to operate with. I called\\nanother friend in Austin, Texas, who then moved this tax-\\ndeferred capital gain into a mini-storage facility. Within\\nthree months, he began receiving checks for a little less\\nthan a $1,000 a month which he then poured back into the\\ncollege fund.\\nA couple of years later, the mini-warehouse sold, and he\\nreceived a check for nearly $330,000 as proceeds from the\\nsale. He rolled those funds into a new project that would\\nnow generate over $3,000 a month in income, again, going\\ninto the college fund.

And when I wanted to learn to ﬂy, I went to Navy\\nﬂight school, a two-year process that turns non-pilots into\\npilots. I was cautious about my next educational process. I\\nwanted to know what I was going to become before I\\nstarted my next educational process.\\nTraditional schools had been good to me. I had achieved\\nmy childhood professions. Reaching adulthood was\\nconfusing because there were no signs saying, “This is the\\nway.” I knew what I didn’t want to do, but I did not know\\nwhat I wanted to do.\\nIt would have been simple if all I wanted was a new\\nprofession.

He would empty them into the large concrete\\nholding tank the village had built. Each morning he had to\\nget up before the rest of the village awoke to make sure\\nthere was enough water for the people.
